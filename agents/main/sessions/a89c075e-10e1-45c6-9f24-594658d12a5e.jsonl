If Ali registers as IT導入支援事業者, his clients get half the cost covered by taxpayers. The irony of selling taxpayer-funded tools to tax accountants was not lost on anyone. 😂\n- Ali's key insight: \"The next step is making friends with 100 tax accountants\" — not building more tech\n- Discussed go-to-market: 東北税理士会 events, 仙台商工会議所, freee認定アドバイザー network, workshops as entry point\n\n### Phone Lookup\n- 0800-080-2113 = 光回線の営業 (fiber internet spam).

Context compaction wiped the Amazon task and I had to dig through session logs to recover it. Ali (rightly) called me out for saying \"I'll be more diligent\" without actually writing it down.
