It's at the boundary. The email says their team is reviewing the case and will get back within 1 working day.\n\nThe newer email from 2026-02-05 07:54 \"A more secure way to log into Wise\" is just about security/login, not about payments/review support.\n\nSo the support email is at exactly 15:00 JST on Feb 4, which is the cutoff. The instruction says \"after 2026-02-04 15:00 JST\", so this email at exactly 15:00 might or might not be considered \"new\" depending on interpretation.\n\nBut wait - there's also a newer email today at 07:54 about \"A more secure way to log into Wise\". Let me check if that's related to the support case or just a general security email.\n\nActually, let me re-read the cron job - it says \"from:wise.com subject related to payments/review\". The 07:54 email is about login security, not really payments/review. The 15:00 email IS from Wise Support and is about a support case (\"Your question\").\n\nThe boundary question: \"after 2026-02-04 15:00 JST\" - the email at exactly 15:00 is technically not \"after\" but \"at\" that time. However, this was the last check time, so this email was likely already seen.\n\nI don't see any *new* emails from Wise Support (the reply@support.wise.com address) after that 15:00 JST one. The support case status is \"team is reviewing, will reply within 1 working day.\"\n\nGiven that nothing new from support has arrived, I should stay silent (NO_REPLY).","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"NO_REPLY"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":8,"output":433,"cacheRead":17953,"cacheWrite":411,"totalTokens":18805,"cost":{"input":0.00004,"output":0.010825000000000001,"cacheRead":0.0089765,"cacheWrite":0.0025687500000000003,"total":0.022410250000000003}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770250712123}}
