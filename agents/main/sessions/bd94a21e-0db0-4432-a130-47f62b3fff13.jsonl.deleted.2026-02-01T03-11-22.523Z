Kokubuncho is a relatively safe area¹ to walk around in. As a foreigner the kyacchi won't bother you much, and getting drugged and tricked out of huge sums of money is practically unheard of. The area is filled with hostess clubs, girls bars, snack bars and regular drinking establishments. More than you could visit if you went out every night for an year, but not enough to keep you busy for three.\n/Users/najafali/Desktop/ali-vault//reflect-import/reflect-alinajaf-20240430-2205-v1.0/Speed-running Sendai.md:111:There's a very high-end snack bar in kokubuncho, it doesn't show up on maps. It's run by a 42-year old mama who wears a kimono, sings old songs on the karaoke machine and occasionally plays the shamisen. She's known for her beauty and hospitality. However her husband died a few years ago, and her boyfriend (who she didn't actually stop seeing while married) passed away a few months after that. A third man in her life passed away within the same year.

I wanted to get a head start on the day so I splashed some cold water on my face, put my glasses on and sat at my terminal.\n\nYesterday was a successful programming day. There were some fundamental problems with the way I was implementing this data sync, I hadn't thought through a handful of edge cases and so I was refactoring code I had just written. I broke a few tests, fixed a few tests, and then ran some end-to-end acceptance tests and they worked on the first or second try. It felt good to be good at something, the code flowed freely and worked like I expected it to. So today the morning meeting with the client went well. We went through a few ideas for other features for me to work on later, and chatted about AI and movies.\n\nIt was a light meeting day at my day job, just my one-to-one with my boss where we complained a lot about the company. The QA team were having problems with the Rahul firing, and I ran some ideas past my boss about trying to get one of our backend engineers to take the initiative on a major refactor that's about four years too late. Mariko appeared during the meeting, treading gently into my office. She would later tell me she was being careful so as to not disturb me on the off chance that I was jerking off. I thought that was considerate of her, but she could have just texted me first.\n\nI did a few light bits of work after the 1:1, giving GitHub access to some engineers, wrote some documentation, and checked in with a few people about a few situations. Then Mariko and I decided to step out for lunch.\n\nI'm a big fan of Kenji Alt. Lopez's blog on Serious Eats, and his recipe book The Food Lab has been my bible for over a decade. His roast potatoes are a revelation. But recently at The Steamers, Masumi has made roast potatoes to rival those of Kenji's. They are perfect. Soft on the inside, crispy and golden on the outside, with roasted garlic cloves and rosemary, and just enough salt. Until I met Masumi, I thought that Japanese people didn't have any idea what the fuck they were doing with potatoes (apart from one important example that we'll get to later). And I wanted Mariko to eat these potatoes. So I walked us in that direction. She made a face about going to The Steamers, she didn't like the smoke, but I insisted.\n\nWhen we got there it was lunch hours and Masumi was not serving roast potatoes, so we gave up on that for today.\n\nOne thing that Mariko and I find amusing is restaurants that play music that are completely inappropriate for the theme. In Sendai Morning Market there's an underground Japanese restaurant that has really good seafood, but we went there once and they were playing Temperature by Sean Paul. Hence forth it was called the Sean Paul place. She felt like going to the Sean Paul restaurant, so we walked through Asaichi and had a nice chirashi-zushi with tonjiru and pickles.\n\nOn the way back I picked up a kilo of shank meat and a big bag of dry soybeans from the market. I was animated, explaining Mary Shellys Frankenstein as one of the first works of science fiction in modern Western literature, and that I was particularly pleased with the new rendition by Guillermo Del Toro starring Oscar Isaacs. There was a confusing discussion after that about the other Del Toro, and I mentioned that I was a fan of Benicio as well, especially in the slow burn crime thriller Reptile that also stars Justin Timberlake. This lead to a discussion about what \"slow burn\" means. It was a fun conversation, for me at least.\n\nWe got back to my home office, I started puffing away on my iqos and doing more writing and thinking. I thought it might be nice to go see my boys this evening. They still had my gancube and I felt a bit rusty on the cube after a few weeks off. I also wanted to give Mamiko child support for the month. Mariko fell asleep on the sofa while watching The Morning Show.\n\nThe Sendai Rinri Houjin kai is something between The Rotary Club and the Freemasons, and Mariko had a little event with them in the evening from 18:00, so she asked me to wake her up by 17:30.\n\nI did some more typing and thinking. I made some notes about ongoing issues at Givery and made my rounds on Jira and GitHub for the day. Then I wrote a bit of documentation for the freelance code that I had written the day before. I was particularly proud of some of the reusable components that fell out of the work, so writing them up was good fun.\n\nI've also been thinking about doing my own version of the Quentin Detest Fest this weekend. I conceptualised it as descending into Dante's circles, with disappointments and mistakes on the outside of the circle, negative patterns of behaviour one layer in, conceptualised as traits one layer deeper with negative emotions and thought patterns clustered around then, and fundamental, deeply maladaptive truths clustered in the centre. Heavy work!\n\nAt 17:33 I walked over to the sofa, cupped Mariko's face and kissed her on the forehead.\n\n\"Wake up you big dohnut\" I said.\n\n\"Hnngf OK\" she said.\n\n\"I haven't seen Sakurai daddy in a while, so I want to drop by today\" I said.\n\n\"He'll be sad about that, you should go see him\" she said.\n\nWe left together, I wanted to get out some money and buy some smokes from the the Family Mart and said goodbye to her there, she was walking up to Kotodai Koen.\n\nI walked into the side alleys, Yabe Sakaba, and daddy poured me a soda and lemon, and we talked about nothing in particular. He asked about how work was going, told me some funny stories about some other tour guide. I asked after mummy. He wanted me to come to their Christmas party on the 24th, apparently he'd bought a ready-made turkey and was confused about how to serve it. He also wanted to know if I might be spending the 24th with my boys and I said I'd be in touch to figure it out. He showed me some very old faded black-and-white photos of him and his friends as a child at the beach. I took a phot of it and sent it to Mariko. I got up to leave, asked him to let me pay him some money and he told me to fuck off, so I laughed and waved goodbye, pushing aside the noren and sliding the door closed behind me.\n\nI was hungry so decided I was getting my potatoes, so went into The Steamers and had a coffee and potatoes while smoking a few cigarettes and chatting with Masumi. She said she really liked the girl I brought there on Sunday, Aya-chan.\n\n\"She seemed really bright. Super young though.\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah she's a nice girl, she's OK\" I said, taking a drag on my cigarette.\n\nI paused to think.\n\n\"But she's not someone I'm going to fall in love with. I kinda want to fall in love again soon, just for the fun of it\" I said.\n\n\"So she's not really your type?\" asked Masumi.\n\n\"She's good fun. It may seem shallow, but it's about looks\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, you like girls with a bit more spice to them. Maybe a bit older\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah, yes, about 26 to around thirty four seems about just right. Girls that are cute but have their look put together, they're cute but they're trying to be pretty\" I said.\n\n\"You just want Kana back\" she said.\n\n\"Guilty as charged\" I said. \"I was quite fond of her.\"\n\nThis gave me pause. It touched a deep wound. I changed the subject, made some jokes about something, we laughed a lot.\n\nI texted Mamiko that I want to come over and drop off the child support money, asked if it was OK to stop by. She took a minute to respond with just one word \"Anytime\".\n\nI went home to pick up the money then hopped into a taxi from outside of Fujisaki. The taxi driver was calm, professional, with a clear voice and zero drama. This is actually quite rare, and I appreciated. I thought about whether I'd still be able to solve the cube after such a long break.\n\nTwenty years ago when I was much younger, more ambitious, and completely oblivious to what the world had in store for me, I met Mamiko in Miyako in Iwate prefecture, my JET placement, a small coastal town in the cold dark north of Japan. After a summer romance we began a difficult marriage, both of us incapable of handling our own or each others emotions. After ten years in the UK and two children, we eventually moved back to Japan in 2018, separated and divorced a few years later.\n\nThe house was calm. Ryu was in the bath, Kei was playing Roblox on an IPad he had just got. I was happy to see him. Mamiko was calm and unagitated, and talking playfully with Kei, him ignoring her for the screen but answering with a few funny well-timed comments and puns. Mamiko gave me an update about how they were both doing. She was somewhere between friendly and neutral today, and I was glad that no one was having an emotional outburst. She was unsure about her parenting decisions, and I reassured her that she was doing a great job.\n\nI found my gancube on the coffee table, it had some kind of gunk on it which I was surprised about. Apparently Kei had been playing with it before/after eating so I teased him a little for gunking it up. I scruffed up his hair a bit as he explained everything happening in Roblox to me. I sat next to him and saw if I could solve my cube. The action was somehow gunked up as well, the movement a lot more clunky than I remembered it a week ago. I definitely remembered my beginner method algorithms which felt good. I continued solving it again and again while I chatted with him and Mamiko he played Roblox.\n\nRyu emerged from the shower, towering over us. What was once a small, pig-nosed baby that I could easily carry around on one forearm was now an awkward, gangly pre-teen, messy hair and bumfluff on his upper lip. I got up and pushed him around, gave him an awkward hug, and asked after him. He responded in grunts, as was his way recently. I smiled and told him to text me sometimes.\n\nHe hung around in front of the heater, watched Kei play Roblox, then went to the futon in the back room behind the living room and played with his phone. I went over to the futon and asked him a few questions, more grunts. I was happy for the time with him. I said I want to watch the new Frankenstein movie with him and said we should do that next time, and did a few more solves on my cube. I talked to Mamiko a little more, then called my taxi.\n\nBack in Iroha Yokocho I walked around trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I was a bit restless and hungry. The yokochos were quiet, and Tori Yoshi was quiet, with a group of three salaryman at the end of the counter and no one else in the shop, so I thought it might be a good chance to show face have a relaxed meal, encompassing the jagamaru.\n\nThe mama, a lady approaching seventy, has been hard of hearing these past few years, so I had to speak up to make my order. She was also a bit funny and witty, and we had a nice rapport. I ordered my jagamaru, a potato cooked in foil low and slow with hokkaido butter for an hour, and ordered liver, wings and negima and started working on a non-alcoholic beer. I was calm and relaxed.\n\nAfter the second world war, Iroha-yokocho emerged as two streets, one a market with some goods prohibited by the occupation, the other with a row of restaurants and drinky bars. The area was administered and supported by the Matsuo-gumi Yakuza group, by their oyabun and a young captain that had made a name for himself by establishing the market. 35 years ago that captain or _wakagashira_ started a yakitori restaurant on the northern Aoba-dori side alley, the place was called Tori Yoshi. Tori Yoshi is now an _institution_ in Sendai, one of the most storied yakitori restaurants we have.\n\nI just refered to him as _Oyakata_ as I never thought to call him anything else. He was surly and gruff at the grill, but occasionally warm and smily with me. I'd often the see the two of them dressed very well out on the town together, and always teased them for being out too late on a school night.\n\nThe mama shouted my order down to the Oyakata and he went to work on my potato. I anticipated my chicken with glee. This was going to be great, I had the place mostly to myself.\n\nI got about one stick in before to my left I looked out the door, and met eyes with a tourist that gingerly working up the courage to enter the store. She was an American lady, walked right in, and asked for the menu in English. The mama looked at her with confusion.\n\nI gestured to the menu myself and the lady pulled out some kind of AR translation app. Stupidly, I offered to help with the menu.\n\n\"Do they have any pescatarian or vegetarian options here?\" she asked me.\n\n\"No, this is a famous chicken restaurant\" I replied, bewildered.\n\n\"Well could you just ask her to rustle up like a vegetable stir fry with some rice or something?\" she asked.\n\n\"That would be very awkward, I'm not going to do that.\" I said, now somewhat agitated.\n\nHer husband came in.\n\n\"Hey, what can we have on the menu that's vegetarian?\" he asked me.\n\n\"It's going to be difficult to find anything vegetarian here\" I said.\n\n\"OK well what do you recommend here?\" he asked.\n\n\"This is a yakitori restaurant, so chicken\" I said.\n\n\"OK well can you just order one stick each for us?\" he said.\n\n\"OK, the options are heart, gizzard, negima...\" I started.\n\n\"Yeah just anything you recommend\" he said, cutting me off.\n\nI was getting annoyed. I had been looking forward to a quiet meal, just me and the mama and the Oyakata. Now I was in full tour-guide mode, for free, but I knew there would be more confusion if I wasn't there. Either way I was locked in for at least another forty minutes waiting for my jagamaru.\n\nThe couple sat to my left. As all of this was happening, two young men came into the restaurant, sat to my right, and started perusing the menu.\n\nThe mama told me that they have a minimum three sticks policy which I relayed to couple. They said they're full and can't have that much, which I relayed to the mama. Then we all just looked at each other awkwardly. What a fucking mess.\n\nThe couple wouldn't leave, so the mama said she would speak to the Oyakata, who just gruffed gruffly at her. She agreed to one stick each. Predictably the couple were also surprised at the table charge, and the cabbage and tofu that came out, complaining that they didn't order it.\n\nEventually things calmed down, I helped them order plum wine. Then the two soft-spoken gentlemen to my right jumped in with broken English, saying that they could use some help ordering too. They were from Indonesia and Taiwan respectively, visiting Tohoku university for a conference on fluid dynamics. I joked that that sounded hard, enjoy your hard maths life, to which they offered resigned chuckles.\n\nThe Oyakata and the mama had an argument about the violation of the three-stick rule, and everything came out in a strange order. My jagamaru was a big event, and everyone stared at it. I told them seriously not to stare at my jagamaru, barely concealing my frustration with a paper-thin layer of humour, as I attempted to tuck into it while diffusing misunderstandings both to my left and my right.\n\nThe Oyakata apologised to the mama for losing his temper and I felt this was quite wholesome.\n\n---\n\nThree or four years ago I was in Jaco, a shochu bar in the Yokochos. The master was playing _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_ muted on a small TV at the end of the bar, The Beatles *Norweigan Wood* on the sound system, and I was drinking a fruity wheat shochu while enjoying some goya champuru. Whisps of eggy egg with bitter strands of goya and a magical chilli oil that tasted alcoholic.\n\nNext to me sat Shuko, a portly Japanese lady who had found me on Hello Talk. She was very keen to talk about sex. For some reason she was under the impression that I was \"Latin\", and so was very excited to tell me that she recently had sex with a Latin guy, and said they move differently during sex. I congratulated her. The longer she spoke the more quickly I wanted to exit the room.\n\nShe was very touchy, and this annoyed me further. I paid my bill and attempted to leave the small seven-seater bar. She said she wanted to tell me a secret and to lean in. Not knowing any better, I leaned in on my right side, and I felt a cold soggy tongue in my ear. I felt ill. I recoiled in terror.\n\nI tried to leave again, and she blocked the exit with her arm. I swung under and out of the door and left her to it. She ran out of the bar calling after me, and I ran away.\n\nI'm not a superstitious person, I don't believe in ghosts or demons, but here's what happened. Over the next few months, I began to slowly lose hearing in my right ear. I didn't know why. I thought that perhaps I was going deaf, so I tried to enjoy classical music, listening to a lot of Liszt and Debussy, just in case my hearing was going for good. I'd been putting off going to the ENT out of fear of it becoming real.\n\nEventually I went, and he took a look at my ears.\n\nMy left side where I could hear was clean.\n\nHe took one look at my right side and jumped back in surprise.\n\n\"Ali-san, this is magnificent. I've never seen a specimen like this.\" he said.\n\n\"Is that good news or bad news?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh it's fine, we can clean this up right now, it might be a bit uncomfortable but your ears are fine.\" he said chippily.\n\nThe young doctor called over a nurse who quickly appeared with some sort of suction tool on wheels, along with an array of implements for some sort of physical medical work.\n\nHe told me to sit back and try to relax as he went to work.\n\nHe did his thing, and it indeed felt a bit uncomfortable. The longer he worked, the clearer I could hear, and I was relieved. At the end he had to pull quite hard on my eardrum and this ached, and stung a bit as he worked.\n\nIt ended with a pop as he pulled it out of my ear.\n\n\"Hey Naoko, come take a look at this bad boy\"  he said excitedly.\n\nHe held in his hand a two inch long creature straight out of artwork from H.R. Giger.  A spiked eldritch horror that was ostensibly a bundle of earwax, from my right ear.\n\nI'm not saying that Shuko impregnated my ear with her demon spawn, but I somewhat suspect that Shuko impregnated my ear with her demon spawn.\n\nLater I would run a popular international exchange event that Shuko would turn up to. We eventually had to ban her because she was so sexually forward with absolutely everyone she met. I wished with all my heart for this to be the end of the Shuko story.\n\n---\nMercifully, the couple asked me to ask for their bill.\n\n\"You know, you're very good at this, you could be paid for this\" the husband said.\n\n\"Actually, I'm a paid tour guide for this area and Sendai at night in general\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, how is tour guiding as a job going for you?\" he asked, a bit condescending.\n\n\"Fine, when I'm paid for it!\" I said, not wanting to explain that it wasn't my full time job.\n\nThey left, finally. I enjoyed a few more sticks.\n\nThey were quickly replaced by a young hostess who appeared to taking a host out on an accompanied date. The hostess had long bright nails, a gucci bag, short skirt and boots. She met my eyes and we recognised each other immediately, but I decided it best not to acknowledge her unless she spoke to me first, I didn't know what was going on with her and the host.\n\nThe host had a bright red down jacket with fur lining, sunglasses, rings on all fingers and a lot of chains. They looked out of place in the smoky, dark-wood showa-era energy of Tori Yoshi. They came in and sat down. At least they would leave me alone and order for themselves I thought. He couldn't have been older than twenty five.\n\nThe mama took their drink order, and started writing it down. The host then started ordering his yakitori, which the mama didn't acknowledge.\n\n\"Looks like you're ignoring me\" he growled at the mama angrily.\n\nI felt a shot of bitter anger through my back.\n\n\"She's hard of hearing\" I said clearly, shooting daggers at him.\n\n\"Thanks for your input\" he said, looking back at me.\n\nNow I was just pissed. But thankfully I was done eating, so I settled my bill and got my tax receipt.\n\n\"Enjoy your time in Sendai boys\" I said to the fluid dynamics kids, then made for the door.\n\nThat's when Shuko appeared in the doorway. She'd lost a bit of weight but I knew it was her, the licker of ears. I assertively walked past her. Enough drama for one day."}],"details":{"status":"completed","exitCode":0,"durationMs":29,"aggregated":"# A day in my strange life in Japan\n\nThe alarm went of gently enough, though I woke up exhausted. I wanted to get a head start on the day so I splashed some cold water on my face, put my glasses on and sat at my terminal.\n\nYesterday was a successful programming day. There were some fundamental problems with the way I was implementing this data sync, I hadn't thought through a handful of edge cases and so I was refactoring code I had just written. I broke a few tests, fixed a few tests, and then ran some end-to-end acceptance tests and they worked on the first or second try. It felt good to be good at something, the code flowed freely and worked like I expected it to. So today the morning meeting with the client went well. We went through a few ideas for other features for me to work on later, and chatted about AI and movies.\n\nIt was a light meeting day at my day job, just my one-to-one with my boss where we complained a lot about the company. The QA team were having problems with the Rahul firing, and I ran some ideas past my boss about trying to get one of our backend engineers to take the initiative on a major refactor that's about four years too late. Mariko appeared during the meeting, treading gently into my office. She would later tell me she was being careful so as to not disturb me on the off chance that I was jerking off. I thought that was considerate of her, but she could have just texted me first.\n\nI did a few light bits of work after the 1:1, giving GitHub access to some engineers, wrote some documentation, and checked in with a few people about a few situations. Then Mariko and I decided to step out for lunch.\n\nI'm a big fan of Kenji Alt. Lopez's blog on Serious Eats, and his recipe book The Food Lab has been my bible for over a decade. His roast potatoes are a revelation. But recently at The Steamers, Masumi has made roast potatoes to rival those of Kenji's. They are perfect. Soft on the inside, crispy and golden on the outside, with roasted garlic cloves and rosemary, and just enough salt. Until I met Masumi, I thought that Japanese people didn't have any idea what the fuck they were doing with potatoes (apart from one important example that we'll get to later). And I wanted Mariko to eat these potatoes. So I walked us in that direction. She made a face about going to The Steamers, she didn't like the smoke, but I insisted.\n\nWhen we got there it was lunch hours and Masumi was not serving roast potatoes, so we gave up on that for today.\n\nOne thing that Mariko and I find amusing is restaurants that play music that are completely inappropriate for the theme. In Sendai Morning Market there's an underground Japanese restaurant that has really good seafood, but we went there once and they were playing Temperature by Sean Paul. Hence forth it was called the Sean Paul place. She felt like going to the Sean Paul restaurant, so we walked through Asaichi and had a nice chirashi-zushi with tonjiru and pickles.\n\nOn the way back I picked up a kilo of shank meat and a big bag of dry soybeans from the market. I was animated, explaining Mary Shellys Frankenstein as one of the first works of science fiction in modern Western literature, and that I was particularly pleased with the new rendition by Guillermo Del Toro starring Oscar Isaacs. There was a confusing discussion after that about the other Del Toro, and I mentioned that I was a fan of Benicio as well, especially in the slow burn crime thriller Reptile that also stars Justin Timberlake. This lead to a discussion about what \"slow burn\" means. It was a fun conversation, for me at least.\n\nWe got back to my home office, I started puffing away on my iqos and doing more writing and thinking. I thought it might be nice to go see my boys this evening. They still had my gancube and I felt a bit rusty on the cube after a few weeks off. I also wanted to give Mamiko child support for the month. Mariko fell asleep on the sofa while watching The Morning Show.\n\nThe Sendai Rinri Houjin kai is something between The Rotary Club and the Freemasons, and Mariko had a little event with them in the evening from 18:00, so she asked me to wake her up by 17:30.\n\nI did some more typing and thinking. I made some notes about ongoing issues at Givery and made my rounds on Jira and GitHub for the day. Then I wrote a bit of documentation for the freelance code that I had written the day before. I was particularly proud of some of the reusable components that fell out of the work, so writing them up was good fun.\n\nI've also been thinking about doing my own version of the Quentin Detest Fest this weekend. I conceptualised it as descending into Dante's circles, with disappointments and mistakes on the outside of the circle, negative patterns of behaviour one layer in, conceptualised as traits one layer deeper with negative emotions and thought patterns clustered around then, and fundamental, deeply maladaptive truths clustered in the centre. Heavy work!\n\nAt 17:33 I walked over to the sofa, cupped Mariko's face and kissed her on the forehead.\n\n\"Wake up you big dohnut\" I said.\n\n\"Hnngf OK\" she said.\n\n\"I haven't seen Sakurai daddy in a while, so I want to drop by today\" I said.\n\n\"He'll be sad about that, you should go see him\" she said.\n\nWe left together, I wanted to get out some money and buy some smokes from the the Family Mart and said goodbye to her there, she was walking up to Kotodai Koen.\n\nI walked into the side alleys, Yabe Sakaba, and daddy poured me a soda and lemon, and we talked about nothing in particular. He asked about how work was going, told me some funny stories about some other tour guide. I asked after mummy. He wanted me to come to their Christmas party on the 24th, apparently he'd bought a ready-made turkey and was confused about how to serve it. He also wanted to know if I might be spending the 24th with my boys and I said I'd be in touch to figure it out. He showed me some very old faded black-and-white photos of him and his friends as a child at the beach. I took a phot of it and sent it to Mariko. I got up to leave, asked him to let me pay him some money and he told me to fuck off, so I laughed and waved goodbye, pushing aside the noren and sliding the door closed behind me.\n\nI was hungry so decided I was getting my potatoes, so went into The Steamers and had a coffee and potatoes while smoking a few cigarettes and chatting with Masumi. She said she really liked the girl I brought there on Sunday, Aya-chan.\n\n\"She seemed really bright. Super young though.\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah she's a nice girl, she's OK\" I said, taking a drag on my cigarette.\n\nI paused to think.\n\n\"But she's not someone I'm going to fall in love with. I kinda want to fall in love again soon, just for the fun of it\" I said.\n\n\"So she's not really your type?\" asked Masumi.\n\n\"She's good fun. It may seem shallow, but it's about looks\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, you like girls with a bit more spice to them. Maybe a bit older\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah, yes, about 26 to around thirty four seems about just right. Girls that are cute but have their look put together, they're cute but they're trying to be pretty\" I said.\n\n\"You just want Kana back\" she said.\n\n\"Guilty as charged\" I said. \"I was quite fond of her.\"\n\nThis gave me pause. It touched a deep wound. I changed the subject, made some jokes about something, we laughed a lot.\n\nI texted Mamiko that I want to come over and drop off the child support money, asked if it was OK to stop by. She took a minute to respond with just one word \"Anytime\".\n\nI went home to pick up the money then hopped into a taxi from outside of Fujisaki. The taxi driver was calm, professional, with a clear voice and zero drama. This is actually quite rare, and I appreciated. I thought about whether I'd still be able to solve the cube after such a long break.\n\nTwenty years ago when I was much younger, more ambitious, and completely oblivious to what the world had in store for me, I met Mamiko in Miyako in Iwate prefecture, my JET placement, a small coastal town in the cold dark north of Japan. After a summer romance we began a difficult marriage, both of us incapable of handling our own or each others emotions. After ten years in the UK and two children, we eventually moved back to Japan in 2018, separated and divorced a few years later.\n\nThe house was calm. Ryu was in the bath, Kei was playing Roblox on an IPad he had just got. I was happy to see him. Mamiko was calm and unagitated, and talking playfully with Kei, him ignoring her for the screen but answering with a few funny well-timed comments and puns. Mamiko gave me an update about how they were both doing. She was somewhere between friendly and neutral today, and I was glad that no one was having an emotional outburst. She was unsure about her parenting decisions, and I reassured her that she was doing a great job.\n\nI found my gancube on the coffee table, it had some kind of gunk on it which I was surprised about. Apparently Kei had been playing with it before/after eating so I teased him a little for gunking it up. I scruffed up his hair a bit as he explained everything happening in Roblox to me. I sat next to him and saw if I could solve my cube. The action was somehow gunked up as well, the movement a lot more clunky than I remembered it a week ago. I definitely remembered my beginner method algorithms which felt good. I continued solving it again and again while I chatted with him and Mamiko he played Roblox.\n\nRyu emerged from the shower, towering over us. What was once a small, pig-nosed baby that I could easily carry around on one forearm was now an awkward, gangly pre-teen, messy hair and bumfluff on his upper lip. I got up and pushed him around, gave him an awkward hug, and asked after him. He responded in grunts, as was his way recently. I smiled and told him to text me sometimes.\n\nHe hung around in front of the heater, watched Kei play Roblox, then went to the futon in the back room behind the living room and played with his phone. I went over to the futon and asked him a few questions, more grunts. I was happy for the time with him. I said I want to watch the new Frankenstein movie with him and said we should do that next time, and did a few more solves on my cube. I talked to Mamiko a little more, then called my taxi.\n\nBack in Iroha Yokocho I walked around trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I was a bit restless and hungry. The yokochos were quiet, and Tori Yoshi was quiet, with a group of three salaryman at the end of the counter and no one else in the shop, so I thought it might be a good chance to show face have a relaxed meal, encompassing the jagamaru.\n\nThe mama, a lady approaching seventy, has been hard of hearing these past few years, so I had to speak up to make my order. She was also a bit funny and witty, and we had a nice rapport. I ordered my jagamaru, a potato cooked in foil low and slow with hokkaido butter for an hour, and ordered liver, wings and negima and started working on a non-alcoholic beer. I was calm and relaxed.\n\nAfter the second world war, Iroha-yokocho emerged as two streets, one a market with some goods prohibited by the occupation, the other with a row of restaurants and drinky bars. The area was administered and supported by the Matsuo-gumi Yakuza group, by their oyabun and a young captain that had made a name for himself by establishing the market. 35 years ago that captain or _wakagashira_ started a yakitori restaurant on the northern Aoba-dori side alley, the place was called Tori Yoshi. Tori Yoshi is now an _institution_ in Sendai, one of the most storied yakitori restaurants we have.\n\nI just refered to him as _Oyakata_ as I never thought to call him anything else. He was surly and gruff at the grill, but occasionally warm and smily with me. I'd often the see the two of them dressed very well out on the town together, and always teased them for being out too late on a school night.\n\nThe mama shouted my order down to the Oyakata and he went to work on my potato. I anticipated my chicken with glee. This was going to be great, I had the place mostly to myself.\n\nI got about one stick in before to my left I looked out the door, and met eyes with a tourist that gingerly working up the courage to enter the store. She was an American lady, walked right in, and asked for the menu in English.

I had been looking forward to a quiet meal, just me and the mama and the Oyakata. Now I was in full tour-guide mode, for free, but I knew there would be more confusion if I wasn't there.

That decision would set the stage for ten years of chaos, discovery, collapse, and eventual rebirth. What began as a new chapter of freedom quickly unraveled into the darkest period of my life—and then, unexpectedly, became the foundation for transformation. This memoir is the story of that decade in Japan, told through the alleys, bars, relationships, and crises that shaped me.\n\nAct 1: All Fun and Games\n\nThe story begins when I arrive at the sharehouse.

Alcohol-fuelled nights with incredible food, beautiful women, chance encounters, and a rolling cast of interesting and weird characters.\n\nThis would culminate with my relationship with Kumakura Kana. Our time together was the most fun anyone could have, stolen kisses, fooling around in stairwells, her being one of the most beautiful women I'd ever have the blind luck to be involved with. We had a tumultuous relationship, that both gave me the best and worst romantic experiences of my life, and forced me to develop self-worth outside of what women think of me.\n\nI was assaulted in the street in a chance encounter with Taira Yoshio. While the police initially thought I was the culprit, I eventually won an out of court settlement. This side quest lead me on an adventure taking me meet some of the oldest old money in Sendai in a little-known bar named Boxer, which introduced me to the legendary Setsuko mama and the den of evil.\n\nThis is also where the stakes get higher, and the pain is delivered. Mariko found out about Kana and it hurt her deeply. I was more and more disliked by the other foreigners around me, though I got my revenge by starting an increasingly popular international exchange group.

This was the dark night of the soul. Kana had stopped calling me, but I saw her with another man in Rocco, we had a huge fight, and I ended up screaming with rage in my place, wanting it all to end.\n\nAct 3: A Way Forward\n\nIn this arc is where we start to recover, transform, and move forward.\n\nI knew I had to change, I didn't want my life to be filled with so much pain, and so I turned to Zen to help me figure it out. Matt got me thinking, Kana gave me the fuel, and I ended up regularly visiting Rinnoji, a local zen temple.\n\nThis is also the time I met with the local entrepreneur (who it turns out, was guilty of the largest subsidy fraud in recent history) and developed a sense of bitterness for all of his hypocrisy.\n\nStill there were odd affairs here and there, fun vignettes about Shiho, Chika, and one or two others.

[[Sendai]] is my adopted home. I just got back from a trip to Tokyo this weekend and I have... thoughts.\n\nI live in central Sendai, on a shopping arcade street the kind of which is common across all of Japan. My flat is a 4LDK at 98m², and is right in the middle of the [[Sendai]] central business district, so people assume I'm fabulously wealthy (narrator: he is not fabulously wealthy). My building is filled with retired couples and a small handful of families.\n\nIf I step out of my building there's a Tomods (national pharmacy chain store) on the ground floor. To my left there's a Family Mart and above that is my gym. It has 8 power racks, lots of machines, very spacious and is rarely crowded. Further in that direction is a McDonalds on my left, and across the street the arcade continues with Moncler and Louis Vuitton [[Sendai]] stores flanking me.\n\nOut of my mansion, if instead of turning left I go straight across the arcade, I have bunka yokocho and iroho yokocho in front of me (yokocho just means \"side street\"). These are picturesque Japanese side-streets packed with tiny little bars and restaurants that can only fit seven or eight people. There around 370 establishments like this in the yokochos. As I write this, if I look left from my screen and out of the window, I can see the glass canopy of the arcade a few meters in front of me and the tin roofs over the yokochos beyond it.\n\nIf we go back to the original left past the designer stores, walk straight through the arcade for about seven minutes, we end up in Kokubuncho, the central entertainment area in Sendai. Kokubuncho is a relatively safe area¹ to walk around in. As a foreigner the kyacchi won't bother you much, and getting drugged and tricked out of huge sums of money is practically unheard of. The area is filled with hostess clubs, girls bars, snack bars and regular drinking establishments. More than you could visit if you went out every night for an year, but not enough to keep you busy for three.\n\n## Exploration\n\nAfter my divorce in 2019 I spent many of my evenings exploring Sendai. My basic MO was to walk into a small bar or restaurant, inevitably start chatting with the owner or other customers, and then ask for recommendations for other places to go.\n\nPeople in [[Sendai]] are intrigued when foreigners end up in bars with a typically Japanese only clientele. I try to ask lots of questions, and everyone likes to talk about themselves. They're also happy that they can speak freely in Japanese with me and there isn't much friction in communication.\n\nSometimes I'll take their recommendations and go there immediately. [[Sendai]] is small enough that you can just hear directions and just walk over to wherever the place is. Other times I'd note it down and start the night there some other time. I kept going out like this until there was no more \"fog of war\" in Sendai. I know the main roads, the back streets, which bar owner has some beef with some other bar owner, who is who's sempai/kohai etc.\n\nDoing all of this exploring gave me extremely strong social skills in Japanese. I was able to relate to and converse with a huge variety of characters. Your regular salaryman away from his family on 単身赴任, 22yo university students, 2nd generation company owners, real estate magnates, bartenders and restaurant owner/operators running their place for 30 years like something out of shinya shokudo. Part of me wanted to _deeply_ understand people and Japanese culture on a human level, rather than just enjoy the food and the aesthetic like a tourist.\n\nI somehow got a reputation for knowing everyone and everywhere. I got very good at lending an ear and getting people to share their secrets, worries, and desires. I can walk through central [[Sendai]] on the average day and run into two or three people I know. Along the way I made many acquaintances, a few friends, and a handful of enemies.\n\nMany of those skills, connections, and adventures started and ended in the world of mizu shobai.\n\n## The Water Business™\n\nI would be lying if I said that the only reason I'm interested in mizu shobai was out of a deep interest in Japanese culture. But I'm going to try and say it anyway, so bear with me.\n\nI've never really liked anime or manga. And Japanese food, or should I say, Japanese culinary skill, is second to none. I'm extremely happy with the food here. Japanese history is interesting. Some Japanese movies and TV shows are good (I was young in the 90s so I particularly like Beat Takeshi yakuza movies and that era in general).\n\nThere are many, many foreigners in Japan that are here because they like anime, manga, or some aspect of Japanese culture. In Japanese you might call them _otaku_, or even _hentai_, which in this context means someone who is obsessed with something to an extreme degree.\n\nI do not judge this at all. If you really freaking love anime and you managed to make it over to Japan and spend all your time immersed in anime, watching it, talking about it, going to events, living that anime fan life, then more power to you. If anything, I'm jealous of that level of passion and that you get to live your best life out here.\n\nI however, am just not that into anime. But I am however obsessed with the water business, specifically hostess clubs, girls bars, and sometimes snacks.\n\nFrom [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_and_hostess_clubs):\n\n> _A _**_hostess club_**_ is a type of _[_night club_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_club)_ found primarily in Japan. They employ primarily female staff and cater to men seeking drinks and attentive conversation... Host and hostess clubs are considered part of _[_mizu shōbai_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizu_sh%C5%8Dbai) _(literally \"water trade\"), the night-time entertainment business in Japan._\n\n_Note that you can read that article in wikipedia and get a general idea of what it is, but there are many generalizations that are misleading or plain incorrect. As with everything, there's a lot of nuance, regional variation etc._\n\nLike any _otaku _I'm obsessed with the details_. The hand signals the girls/kurofuku use to communicate without words, and how they differ from one place to the next. The interpersonal dynamics between girls earning at different levels. How you're treated differently depending on whether the shop has revenue-based or point-based compensation for the girls. The decor, uniforms, types of customers, etc.\n\nIt's an extremely rich and detailed culture that is specific to Japan, that not even Japanese people on the whole know very much about. So for my programmer brain that lives on distinguishing and categorising fine details, hanging out at these places and absorbing everything about it is my nerd crack.\n\nOf course, _of course,_ it's also just a lot of fun. Sitting next to insanely beautiful, model-level women while they serve you drinks and give you a lot of attention is just, fun. Provided you don't get needy and just enjoy the experience for what it is, depending on the people involved it _can_ be an extremely fun experience.\n\nAnd like my other adventures, it gave me lots of time and space to develop my social skills. I made a game of trying to make girls laugh as hard as possible (five points for getting them to spray their drink, because they won't fake that). Through all of this my Japanese conversational ability skyrocketed even more.\n\nWhile at first while I was still getting used to all this, there were a couple of one-itis situations. Once I got that out of my system I ended up fooling around with a couple of hostesses outside of their shop, and then dating one of them longer term. This taught me even _more_ about their world, perhaps more than I wanted to know.\n\nFor example, many of their customers invite girls to meet プライベートで, on their day off, typically Sunday. A lot of the girls reply that they have beauty appointments, or just want to sleep in on Sunday. The customers doubt these excuses. They accuse the girls of having boyfriends and berate them for being unresponsive.\n\nBut if you actually start spending time with some of these girls outside of work, you'll see that they have at least three, maybe four beauty related appointments per week. Hair, hair removal, skincare, nails, eyelashes, gym, buying clothes, and so on. And when they're not at those appointments, they need to catch up on sleep, simply because of how bad their sleep is with the amount of [[Alcohol]] they're consuming. I saw one sleep 18 hours straight on my futon, Sunday morning through night. And they drink gallons of water every day to counterract the effects of the gallons of Veuve yellow they have to drink during work.\n\n## The Pattern\n\nSo this sets some of the scene for my life at night in Sendai. Let's walk through what a typical evening in [[Sendai]] has been like for me over the past few years. In this example I will weave together a handful of events that actually happened, and change the names of people and places to protect the not so innocent.\n\n***\n\nThis night starts the same way as most nights start in [[Sendai]] for me: it's the evening, I'm not with my boys, and I'm both hungry and a bit lonely, so I'll go out to one of the yokochos for a bite to eat and maybe a drink or two. The first place I try is a shochu place with a wiry master is his late fifties, it's cheap, the food is amazing and the regular customers are all friends.\n\nIt's full, and decide I feel like eating beef so head to bunyoko a one minute walk away. The 80yo mama died last year so her son (maybe grandson?) had taken over. Here some of the customers can get a bit shouty with me so I take a look to make sure there are no abjectly terrible drunks in tonights line up. The interior is something out of a showa-era manga, analogue tv on a shelf, photos and newspaper clippings taped to the wall, all deep brown through decades of smoke thanks to the coal-fired barbecues bought to your table. They know me here, but I don't remember anyone's names.\n\nTo my left sits Satoru-san (I forget his last name). My memory throws an exception and reminds me that I once had a one-night stand with the girl he's dating now, and that he was a bit salty about it, but then I remember we talked about it and I took him to a hostess club to bury the hatchet. Anyway I catch up with him, he's in his non-work clothes so probably had the day off today. I order a bottle of beer and short rib and liver for the barbecue. The owner brings me my beer and opens it. Satoru pours it for me and I pour his back.\n\nSitting on the other side of Satoru are two Japanese salarymen in their forties. They overhear this conversation and decide to talk to me. Once they get over praising my Japanese and I crack a few jokes, we exchange personal information. One is a mid-level manager at Tohoku Electrical and the other is a salesman from one of their vendors. Neither are [[Sendai]] natives, but business is done and they're somewhat interested in exploring [[Sendai]] at night.\n\n\"There is no one on Earth that knows [[Sendai]] at night better than this guy?\" says Satoru, gesturing at me.\n\n\"That's a bit of an exaggeration\" I respond, not really believing it\n\n\"No it's not\" cuts in the owner of the shop, his eyes not moving from the meat he's flipping on the barbecue\n\nThey ask me where they should go next and I ask them what their budget is and what sort of place they want to go to. They said they're interested in exploring but want to just have a few drinks somewhere cheap and then figure out where they want to go after talking for a bit more.\n\nSatoru decides he doesn't have the appetite for a night out with me, but the salarymen are down. Once we settle the bill at venue 1 we leave the yokochos and head up to Toichi ichiba. I start getting to know them. One of them is a sales director and is worried about an overall economic downturn. This one strikes me as a particularly bad drunk. The other one is here on tanshin funin and misses his family back in Chiba prefecture.\n\nI take them to an extremely cheap standing izakaya. Every customer there already knows me too and the owner recognises me, shuffles our group to an open space near the bar. There's a girl working at the bar who takes our order.\n\n\"Ali!?\" she says, recognising me, her eyes wide.\n\n\"Have we met?\" I ask. I didn't recognise her with her mask on.\n\n\"You don't remember me?\" she asks. She lowers her mask.\n\nI recognise her from somewhere, instantly. Her hair is different, but that face is unmistakable. It used to be short/bob cut and dyed brown, now it's long but tied up for work. Same massive elephant ears. I jump back in surprise.\n\n\"Mana-chan!\" I say.\n\n\"Who the hell is Mana-chan?\" says some customer next to me.\n\n\"It's been, what, five years? I thought I'd never see you again.\" I say, incredulous.\n\nMana was a girl at a girls bar that I was frequenting many years ago. I had spent many nights drinking into the early hours with Mana. I was never interested in her romantically, never even learned her real name or invited her out outside of work. She had a very controlling (束縛) boyfriend at the time, so when she stopped working at a girls bar he forced her to delete all contacts out of her phone, including mine.\n\nAt the time of course this gave me a brief moment of pause, but it's par for the course in that world. Can't be helped. I had resigned her to the annals of people I once knew so its fun and interesting to see her in real life and catch up. The other customers and two salarymen I brought with me are bewildered, assuming we used to be a romantic couple, we quickly change the subject. She tells me she works shifts Sunday and Thursday so I make a note to catch up with her one on one at some point in the future.\n\nI also run into my good friends Tim and James there with a gaggle of new JETs in their twenties, still excited to have finally arrived in Japan. Tim is a chemical engineer and James is researching autonomous vehicle AI at Tohoku university. Both are out to socialize, learn Japanese, meet girls, and do young guy stuff. I try to meet all of the JET's and introduce myself.\n\nWe order high balls. The salarymen are surprised that everyone knows me. I ask them more about their individual situations, what they do at their companies. They're both well-educated so I absorb a handful of new vocab and new cultural knowledge from the conversation. We have a few more drinks, I introduce them to the people around me. They say the want to go to maybe one more place and then maybe call it a night.\n\nI tell them that there's a world-class \"authentic bar\" about a minute away. The bartender is an absolute demon, and strawberries are in season. You're going to have the best strawberry cocktail of your life.\n\nThe three of us settle up and head to the bar. As usual Kurihara-san (the demon bartender) is friendly and chatty. We all ask for some kind of strawberry concoction, leaving the details to him. The decor, vibe, and level of skill is worthy of it's own Netflix documentary. Watching him go, polishing ice, washing it, arranging ingredients, pouring out measures, is watching a master at work. And the finished product perfect in flavour and texture. Thick, velvety, very strawberry, you can barely taste the [[Alcohol]] from the champagne.\n\nWe talk more and the salarymen ask me what's the weirdest place I've been to is in Sendai. I tell them they wouldn't believe me, but I'll try to explain.\n\nThere's a very high-end snack bar in kokubuncho, it doesn't show up on maps. It's run by a 42-year old mama who wears a kimono, sings old songs on the karaoke machine and occasionally plays the shamisen. She's known for her beauty and hospitality. However her husband died a few years ago, and her boyfriend (who she didn't actually stop seeing while married) passed away a few months after that. A third man in her life passed away within the same year. Her snack is bar is dark, with expensive whiskeys, rare blended shochus and kokubuncho yakuza and company directors (line is blurry there) as her customers.\n\nThey're intrigued, or perhaps just have a morbid curiosity. They no longer want to go home. They ask me how I know about this place and I tell them it's a long story (it's a very long story, involving a whole other cast of characters). The bar is literally called \"the den of evil\".\n\nWhat I don't tell them is that the mama tells that story openly and also has a habit of taking home her customers, as a handful of people I took there have reported back to me. Good for her I think, but her stories and the nonchalantness with which she tells them scare me.\n\nWe walk over to her bar in kokubuncho and she greets me at the door. She's not in a kimono, but I remember she told me it's because her excema was playing up. I ask about that and after her six-year old daughter, who she keeps in a night nursery while she works (very common set up for night workers who are also mothers).\n\nOnce we're in I notice the company owner of a local izakaya chain with an account manager from one of the two big alcohhol distributors sitting in a box seat. The izakaya shacho is Jabba-the-hutt fat, smoking a fat cigar wearing a polo shirt looking like an enormous smoky marshmallow. I go over and greet them. I can't remember what happened but it's likely we went out drinking at one point, maybe I introduced him to this snack? He has an expensive bottle of champagne at his table. Once the salarymen and I are sat at the counter, Jabba gestures to the mama to pour us a glass each of the nice champagne.\n\nI am completely tone-deaf but I decide to sing some Aerosmith and ドライフラワー which I'm into in the moment. The salarymen are amazed by this place but are now completely drunk, so we decide to leave in an hour.\n\nGuy sitting directly to my left is Sasaki san. He starts talking to me. He's in his early, maybe mid sixties. It turns out he is my ex-wife's next door neighbour. I buy him a drink and apologise for my youngest screaming and crying so much. He says not to worry, he misses the sounds of kids running around.\n\nThe original two salarymen are fully cooked, decide to leave early. They thank me for a great night, I tell them to be safe on the way home. Sasaki-san says he has one more venue left in him for the night, maybe a hostess club, and do I have any suggestions? I laugh. Sure, I can think of a few places.\n\nWe leave the den of evil and head a bit further down Kokubuncho-dori. Some of the experienced kyacchi greet me and ask me what I'm up to tonight. We know each other by name at this point. I've drunk with a handful of them at very sketchy places over the years.\n\nThe club I'm going to take him to is on the second floor of the building in front of us. The elevator opens onto a dark entrance, red velvet on the walls. The DJ is playing \"I Feel it Coming\" by The Weeknd. The doorman greets me by name and asks if it'll be the same as usual. I tell him yes please.\n\nAfter checking over the radio the doorman escorts us to our our seat. The walk to our seats is like a the one-shot walk through scene in goodfellas. The girls waiting in the corridor door nod/bow in my direction while fidgeting with their phones. The store head, a big former judo guy who's known me for years bows deep and gestures to the main floor. It's a busy night, lots of customers notice me walk in, a one or two of them know my face. Mostly they're still just surprised that a foreigner visits a place like this.\n\nWe ask for shochu on the rocks and one of the floor staff makes it for us. The girl I nominated, Hanako, is set here, so I don't really get a choice in the matter unless I make a point of it. A few minutes later a couple of girls I don't know are brought to our table. I'm pretty drunk, and Sasaki-san is pretty wasted too, but he's still talking to the girls and having a good time.\n\nA few moments later, Hanako is brought over to our table and one of the other girls leaves. Hanako is 27. The easiest way to describe Hanako is that she's like a Japanese Ariana Grande. Stunningly beautiful but also offensively good at her job. In a club of about forty girls she consistently takes a top 4 spot in the revenue/point rankings while still only working three or four nights a week, and balancing a day job. She's also a law-school graduate.\n\nSasaki-san is busy talking to his girl who gets changed out every twenty minutes. Hanako is happy to see me as usual. She's vaping while keeping a keen eye on our drinks. One of the best things about Hanako is she's a complete hardass on everyone she works with to make sure her customers have not a single hiccup in service, the girl makes the trains run on time. I'd been seeing her at this club for maybe two years.\n\nI try to be a good listener and give people as much room to talk as possible, but she is excellent at doing the same to me, paraphrasing what I say, using _active listening_ to get me to verbalise things I didn't even know I wanted to verbalise. The only times I do get her to talk about herself, she talks primarily about her obsessive addiction to Monster Hunter. We also talk a lot about health and fitness, I'd say 80% of our recent conversations centre on things I learned listening to the Huberman Lab podcast. While she's filling up my eighth glass of shochu. It is what it is.\n\nThe DJ is great. 90s hip-hop, lots of 2Pac and Biggie, modern pop too, it's like he is in my on repeat playlist. After an hour I decide I'm tired and I'm ready to go home. We settle up and the girls see us off at the elevator. Sasaki-san decides to go home so I wave goodbye to him. I walk back down Kokubuncho street on the way back to my place.\n\nAs I'm approaching the same building as the den of evil, I notice Tim and James in line at a new club that opened recently (by club I mean like, drinks and music and dancing, not hostess club). They say I should join them. I tell them I'm too old for that kind of thing, but I'll wait with them in line a bit. I tell them they should start talking to some of the groups in front/behind them. They're too shy to do this, so I start talking to those groups, and then mix them in with Tim and James so everyone is having a good time.\n\nAs we get to the door of the club I'm about to take off, when out of somewhere a somewhat rotund older Japanese guy in a baseball cap grabs my collar and starts shouting something at me in heavy Sendai-ben. I am startled and my fight-or-flight response goes into overdrive.\n\nI've been trying recently to get better at emotional regulation. I know in these situations, the best outcomes happen when I use my rational brain, my prefrontal-cortex, but for that part of me to come to the fore I've got to a) at least be aware of my biological response to the situation and b) quiet my first, ego-driven response. However, with this much [[Alcohol]] in me, my pre-frontal cortex being depressed, it was difficult to get there.\n\nBut I try. My \"inner child\" sent up the bat signal to my rational self, asking for help. I tried to stay calm. First I strip his grip to get me out of immediate danger. Then I take stock of the situation.\n\nTo guys right was a younger guy, covered in tattoos holding guys wallet and bag. All gucci. I felt guys hands in mine and noticed something odd. He had no pinky or ring fingers on either hand. LV sunglasses and irezumi peaking up out of his t-shirt.\n\nAt that point my memory kicks in.\n\n\"Hey, we've met before. You go that girls bar, the Honeybee Club right?\" I ask, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\n\"Yeah I remember you! You're friends with Genki-san right?\" he asks, his face cracking a smile.\n\nWe chat for a bit. He was going into the same club as Tim and James but didn't have to wait the line. I tell him these two are my friends so let's all try to have fun.\n\nJust then a small woman in a kimono in her 80s shuffles past.\n\n\"Seiji, did I just see you put your hands on Ali-san?\" she asks.\n\nThe old man sobers up immediately.\n\n\"Do you know him?\" he asks the lady, in suddenly very measured Japanese.\n\n\"Yes. He's a member and an important customer\" she says, looking directly at him.\n\n\"I'm very sorry. Please accept my apologies\" he says to her as she walked on.\n\nShe looks over at me briefly and I bow deep.\n\n\"How the hell do you know Retsuko-mama?\" he asks, astonished.\n\n\"It's a long story\" I respond.\n\nRetsuko-mama is the aforementioned \"last boss\" of Kokubuncho. Politicians curry favour with her, she is the \"fixer\" behind the scenes and no big deals get done in [[Sendai]] without her knowing about them. Her exploits and wealth are of legend. Godmother, don, powerbroker, call her what you will, but a good business card to have in your wallet, let's put it that way.\n\nMy heart is still racing at this point and sit down in front of a convenience store for a moment to catch my breath. I don't really enjoy fighty situations, but think at the moment that this is going to be one hell of a story, how could anyone believe this?\n\nI check my phone and Hanako sent me a quick thank you note. I send her a note back thanking her again for today. I tell her a fun thing just happened, I'll tell her about it next time.\n\nJust then I get a text from Kaede. I'm both happy that she's contacting me and also tired thinking about what the next six hours are going to be like, especially if she's had a lot to drink. She says she's just finishing up work and wants to hang out and maybe stay over at mine tonight.\n\nI wait for a bit but I get no response from her, so go to a late-night tonkotsu ramen place. It's a bit rowdy near the entrance, someone just threw up. I go inside and get my tonkotsu ramen. While I'm there Kaede texts me and asks me to wait around until 3am because one of her customers bought some champagne and she has to go on an after with them.\n\nI say OK, but decide I'll head back to mine first and maybe fall asleep. About 90m later she calls me, she's very drunk and clearly not well. I come back to Kokubuncho street and meet her walking in the opposite direction. She has a miserable look on her face, her makeup is smeared as though she's been crying, and there's a red stain on her all-white top.\n\nShe's not a very huggy girl but I decide to hug her anyway and she starts crying. I take my coat off and drape it on her shoulders, grab her bag, and walk her back to my place. It turns out she had a particularly bad group of customers on the after who went out of their way to make fun of her for being a dumb, ugly, \"countryside hostess\", and one of them went so far as to deliberately spill Tabasco over her clothes.\n\n(For the record she's one of the prettiest girls I've ever met both inside and outside of her club, and is very intelligent, creative, and bright.)\n\nWe go back to my place, we put her clothes in the wash and she wears things she pulls out of my closet. She tells me all about what happened, and manage to get back into good spirits. We sing some disney songs. We're both too drunk to have sex but try anyway. The result is a somewhat sloppy but otherwise enjoyable mess. After we go out onto my balcony, sipping chu-hais and talking for the next four hours as we watch the sun come up.\n\nWhen I wake up the next day she's gone. Did I imagine her? I have a terrible but serviceable hangover, but not much energy to do anything else. What a bonkers night, how did that happen?\n\n***\n\nSounds unbelievable? Dear reader, this is not a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, **it's a Tuesday**. Or maybe this sort of night is normal for you, I don't know. I have no frame of reference.\n\n## [[Sendai]] at night as a Rogue-like\n\nI never played Rogue itself but I've played a couple of modern Rogue-likes, like _Dead Cells _and _Hades. _You play the same levels from the start on each \"run\" of the game. In modern games like this, each run allows you to take some items, experience, skills into the next run. Rooms or enemies may be placed differently each time, but you get to know more of the characters as you progress further into the game on each run. And there are items, prizes, high scores to be attained, and challenges to overcome and skills to learn.\n\nThat, is what a night out in [[Sendai]] is like to me. Each time I go out I might go over familiar territory or I might explore new dungeons. All types of challenges might be thrown my way that I have to overcome, learning something about myself in the process. I get to use and improve my Japanese social ability. Old characters rotate in and out, I discover new connections, and new side-quests appear. Gaining some skill and recognition is a huge ego boost.\n\nBut like any Rogue-like you spend hundreds of hours of your life in, a point comes when you look at the hours played counter and ask yourself, isn't this just about enough? There are a few counterarguments:\n- I'm having an incredible amount of fun. I don't know anyone that is having as much fun in Japan as I am. And it is getting more fun on each run, not less.\n- I am improving, both in Japanese conversational ability and ability to network, at an increasingly rapid rate. I've always been a relatively good networker but my skills are much tighter and more refined after these past few years.\n\nThere isn't much I can point to as an achievement that's come out of all of this. Part of me wanted to make [[Sendai]] more used to foreigners and foreigners more used to Sendai. So I used my social ability, connections, etc to start [[Sendai]][ International Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/sendai-international-meetups-the-new-era/), an international exchange event that me and a friend have worked up to getting a regular attendance of about fifty people, which for [[Sendai]] is not insignificant.\n\nThis allows me to bring together a lot of the characters I've met and take them to a lot of the places I've discovered. I also like that I've been able to introduce people to each other and create friendships and romantic engagements, if not relationships.\n\nBut there are three problems that playing this particular Rogue-like has brought into my life that are getting in the way of other things:\n- [[Alcohol]] consumption. I don't like drinking alone so I'm not sure that I'm physically addicted to alcohol, but it's become a very, very regular fixture in my life. I should probably drink less.\n- Sex addiction. Not much more to say about that, it is what it is. Obviously very fun and not sure I'm going to stop, but it's definitely a distraction.\n- Time and energy. Dealing with all of these adventures takes a lot out of your physically, and just recovering from hangovers leaves very little time for basically anything else.\n\nRecent events have made me question how much many more runs I have left in me. I haven't made any decisions yet but I'm definitely sitting and thinking about whether it may be it's time for a new season.\n\n## Planet-scale success\n\nIt's March 2023 and I'm very unemployed. Three things happened:\n- SVB Bank something something. I think the correct term is \"imploded\" but I don't have the knowledge to speak about this intelligently.\n- OpenAI unleashed ChatGPT, sending many programmers and tech leadership people into an existential crisis.\n- There were tens of thousands of layoffs in bigtech, flooding the market with senior engineering talent\n\nI'm on OK senior Ruby on Rails developer, and I work freelance, in Japan. However, I had stopped networking entirely since Happy Bear Software wrapped up, so I have no options in front of me. I briefly attempted a cold-emailing campaign but decided that I'll just stick to what I do best: networking, starting with my friends back in London.\n\nI got back in touch with very many people, getting on zoom calls and it was great to be able to talk shop with people in English. It was also good to see where everyone had got to in their careers after all this time.\n\nAs a part of this an old friend suggested visiting him in Tokyo. He, like an unnamed member of my family, is professionally successful on a planet-wide scale. But having a conversation with either of these two people throws into sharp relief what I might have achieved had I focused more on creating things.\n\nAnd it's not just those two. Any cursory glance through Indie Hackers podcast guest list or even other people I've been on calls with over the past few weeks and you have countless examples of people with a similar professional background as me going on to attain enviable levels of success. This all hit hard when after my conversation with my good friend in Tokyo.\n\nFor now, I need to put money in the bank somehow and finding new work via networking is the only way I know how to do that. And whatever I do next will involve me being sociable and networking and collaborating with people.\n\nThere will be more speed-runs through [[Sendai]] and many adventures to come, but after spending time with so many monstrously successful people, I think it's time for me to make a good attempt at other things. At goals and dreams I've neglected for almost twenty years. Part of me was worried that these things would never happen for me, but another part of me thinks that maybe everything happened the way it did for a reason.\n\n#### Footnotes\n\n_[1]: One day buy me a drink and I will regale you with some anecdotes to the contrary._"}],"details":{"status":"completed","exitCode":0,"durationMs":41,"aggregated":"I've lived in [[Sendai]] for nearly five years, out of a total of nearly seven in Japan. [[Sendai]] is my adopted home. I just got back from a trip to Tokyo this weekend and I have... thoughts.\n\nI live in central Sendai, on a shopping arcade street the kind of which is common across all of Japan. My flat is a 4LDK at 98m², and is right in the middle of the [[Sendai]] central business district, so people assume I'm fabulously wealthy (narrator: he is not fabulously wealthy). My building is filled with retired couples and a small handful of families.\n\nIf I step out of my building there's a Tomods (national pharmacy chain store) on the ground floor. To my left there's a Family Mart and above that is my gym. It has 8 power racks, lots of machines, very spacious and is rarely crowded. Further in that direction is a McDonalds on my left, and across the street the arcade continues with Moncler and Louis Vuitton [[Sendai]] stores flanking me.\n\nOut of my mansion, if instead of turning left I go straight across the arcade, I have bunka yokocho and iroho yokocho in front of me (yokocho just means \"side street\"). These are picturesque Japanese side-streets packed with tiny little bars and restaurants that can only fit seven or eight people. There around 370 establishments like this in the yokochos. As I write this, if I look left from my screen and out of the window, I can see the glass canopy of the arcade a few meters in front of me and the tin roofs over the yokochos beyond it.\n\nIf we go back to the original left past the designer stores, walk straight through the arcade for about seven minutes, we end up in Kokubuncho, the central entertainment area in Sendai. Kokubuncho is a relatively safe area¹ to walk around in. As a foreigner the kyacchi won't bother you much, and getting drugged and tricked out of huge sums of money is practically unheard of. The area is filled with hostess clubs, girls bars, snack bars and regular drinking establishments. More than you could visit if you went out every night for an year, but not enough to keep you busy for three.\n\n## Exploration\n\nAfter my divorce in 2019 I spent many of my evenings exploring Sendai. My basic MO was to walk into a small bar or restaurant, inevitably start chatting with the owner or other customers, and then ask for recommendations for other places to go.\n\nPeople in [[Sendai]] are intrigued when foreigners end up in bars with a typically Japanese only clientele. I try to ask lots of questions, and everyone likes to talk about themselves. They're also happy that they can speak freely in Japanese with me and there isn't much friction in communication.\n\nSometimes I'll take their recommendations and go there immediately. [[Sendai]] is small enough that you can just hear directions and just walk over to wherever the place is. Other times I'd note it down and start the night there some other time. I kept going out like this until there was no more \"fog of war\" in Sendai. I know the main roads, the back streets, which bar owner has some beef with some other bar owner, who is who's sempai/kohai etc.\n\nDoing all of this exploring gave me extremely strong social skills in Japanese. I was able to relate to and converse with a huge variety of characters. Your regular salaryman away from his family on 単身赴任, 22yo university students, 2nd generation company owners, real estate magnates, bartenders and restaurant owner/operators running their place for 30 years like something out of shinya shokudo. Part of me wanted to _deeply_ understand people and Japanese culture on a human level, rather than just enjoy the food and the aesthetic like a tourist.\n\nI somehow got a reputation for knowing everyone and everywhere. I got very good at lending an ear and getting people to share their secrets, worries, and desires. I can walk through central [[Sendai]] on the average day and run into two or three people I know. Along the way I made many acquaintances, a few friends, and a handful of enemies.\n\nMany of those skills, connections, and adventures started and ended in the world of mizu shobai.\n\n## The Water Business™\n\nI would be lying if I said that the only reason I'm interested in mizu shobai was out of a deep interest in Japanese culture. But I'm going to try and say it anyway, so bear with me.\n\nI've never really liked anime or manga. And Japanese food, or should I say, Japanese culinary skill, is second to none. I'm extremely happy with the food here. Japanese history is interesting. Some Japanese movies and TV shows are good (I was young in the 90s so I particularly like Beat Takeshi yakuza movies and that era in general).\n\nThere are many, many foreigners in Japan that are here because they like anime, manga, or some aspect of Japanese culture. In Japanese you might call them _otaku_, or even _hentai_, which in this context means someone who is obsessed with something to an extreme degree.\n\nI do not judge this at all. If you really freaking love anime and you managed to make it over to Japan and spend all your time immersed in anime, watching it, talking about it, going to events, living that anime fan life, then more power to you. If anything, I'm jealous of that level of passion and that you get to live your best life out here.\n\nI however, am just not that into anime. But I am however obsessed with the water business, specifically hostess clubs, girls bars, and sometimes snacks.\n\nFrom [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_and_hostess_clubs):\n\n> _A _**_hostess club_**_ is a type of _[_night club_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_club)_ found primarily in Japan. They employ primarily female staff and cater to men seeking drinks and attentive conversation... Host and hostess clubs are considered part of _[_mizu shōbai_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizu_sh%C5%8Dbai) _(literally \"water trade\"), the night-time entertainment business in Japan._\n\n_Note that you can read that article in wikipedia and get a general idea of what it is, but there are many generalizations that are misleading or plain incorrect. As with everything, there's a lot of nuance, regional variation etc._\n\nLike any _otaku _I'm obsessed with the details_. The hand signals the girls/kurofuku use to communicate without words, and how they differ from one place to the next. The interpersonal dynamics between girls earning at different levels. How you're treated differently depending on whether the shop has revenue-based or point-based compensation for the girls. The decor, uniforms, types of customers, etc.\n\nIt's an extremely rich and detailed culture that is specific to Japan, that not even Japanese people on the whole know very much about. So for my programmer brain that lives on distinguishing and categorising fine details, hanging out at these places and absorbing everything about it is my nerd crack.\n\nOf course, _of course,_ it's also just a lot of fun. Sitting next to insanely beautiful, model-level women while they serve you drinks and give you a lot of attention is just, fun. Provided you don't get needy and just enjoy the experience for what it is, depending on the people involved it _can_ be an extremely fun experience.\n\nAnd like my other adventures, it gave me lots of time and space to develop my social skills. I made a game of trying to make girls laugh as hard as possible (five points for getting them to spray their drink, because they won't fake that). Through all of this my Japanese conversational ability skyrocketed even more.\n\nWhile at first while I was still getting used to all this, there were a couple of one-itis situations. Once I got that out of my system I ended up fooling around with a couple of hostesses outside of their shop, and then dating one of them longer term. This taught me even _more_ about their world, perhaps more than I wanted to know.\n\nFor example, many of their customers invite girls to meet プライベートで, on their day off, typically Sunday. A lot of the girls reply that they have beauty appointments, or just want to sleep in on Sunday. The customers doubt these excuses. They accuse the girls of having boyfriends and berate them for being unresponsive.\n\nBut if you actually start spending time with some of these girls outside of work, you'll see that they have at least three, maybe four beauty related appointments per week. Hair, hair removal, skincare, nails, eyelashes, gym, buying clothes, and so on. And when they're not at those appointments, they need to catch up on sleep, simply because of how bad their sleep is with the amount of [[Alcohol]] they're consuming. I saw one sleep 18 hours straight on my futon, Sunday morning through night. And they drink gallons of water every day to counterract the effects of the gallons of Veuve yellow they have to drink during work.\n\n## The Pattern\n\nSo this sets some of the scene for my life at night in Sendai. Let's walk through what a typical evening in [[Sendai]] has been like for me over the past few years. In this example I will weave together a handful of events that actually happened, and change the names of people and places to protect the not so innocent.\n\n***\n\nThis night starts the same way as most nights start in [[Sendai]] for me: it's the evening, I'm not with my boys, and I'm both hungry and a bit lonely, so I'll go out to one of the yokochos for a bite to eat and maybe a drink or two. The first place I try is a shochu place with a wiry master is his late fifties, it's cheap, the food is amazing and the regular customers are all friends.\n\nIt's full, and decide I feel like eating beef so head to bunyoko a one minute walk away. The 80yo mama died last year so her son (maybe grandson?) had taken over. Here some of the customers can get a bit shouty with me so I take a look to make sure there are no abjectly terrible drunks in tonights line up. The interior is something out of a showa-era manga, analogue tv on a shelf, photos and newspaper clippings taped to the wall, all deep brown through decades of smoke thanks to the coal-fired barbecues bought to your table. They know me here, but I don't remember anyone's names.\n\nTo my left sits Satoru-san (I forget his last name). My memory throws an exception and reminds me that I once had a one-night stand with the girl he's dating now, and that he was a bit salty about it, but then I remember we talked about it and I took him to a hostess club to bury the hatchet. Anyway I catch up with him, he's in his non-work clothes so probably had the day off today. I order a bottle of beer and short rib and liver for the barbecue. The owner brings me my beer and opens it. Satoru pours it for me and I pour his back.\n\nSitting on the other side of Satoru are two Japanese salarymen in their forties. They overhear this conversation and decide to talk to me. Once they get over praising my Japanese and I crack a few jokes, we exchange personal information. One is a mid-level manager at Tohoku Electrical and the other is a salesman from one of their vendors. Neither are [[Sendai]] natives, but business is done and they're somewhat interested in exploring [[Sendai]] at night.\n\n\"There is no one on Earth that knows [[Sendai]] at night better than this guy?\" says Satoru, gesturing at me.\n\n\"That's a bit of an exaggeration\" I respond, not really believing it\n\n\"No it's not\" cuts in the owner of the shop, his eyes not moving from the meat he's flipping on the barbecue\n\nThey ask me where they should go next and I ask them what their budget is and what sort of place they want to go to. They said they're interested in exploring but want to just have a few drinks somewhere cheap and then figure out where they want to go after talking for a bit more.\n\nSatoru decides he doesn't have the appetite for a night out with me, but the salarymen are down. Once we settle the bill at venue 1 we leave the yokochos and head up to Toichi ichiba. I start getting to know them. One of them is a sales director and is worried about an overall economic downturn. This one strikes me as a particularly bad drunk. The other one is here on tanshin funin and misses his family back in Chiba prefecture.\n\nI take them to an extremely cheap standing izakaya. Every customer there already knows me too and the owner recognises me, shuffles our group to an open space near the bar. There's a girl working at the bar who takes our order.\n\n\"Ali!?\" she says, recognising me, her eyes wide.\n\n\"Have we met?\" I ask. I didn't recognise her with her mask on.\n\n\"You don't remember me?\" she asks. She lowers her mask.\n\nI recognise her from somewhere, instantly. Her hair is different, but that face is unmistakable. It used to be short/bob cut and dyed brown, now it's long but tied up for work. Same massive elephant ears. I jump back in surprise.\n\n\"Mana-chan!\" I say.\n\n\"Who the hell is Mana-chan?\" says some customer next to me.\n\n\"It's been, what, five years? I thought I'd never see you again.\" I say, incredulous.\n\nMana was a girl at a girls bar that I was frequenting many years ago. I had spent many nights drinking into the early hours with Mana. I was never interested in her romantically, never even learned her real name or invited her out outside of work. She had a very controlling (束縛) boyfriend at the time, so when she stopped working at a girls bar he forced her to delete all contacts out of her phone, including mine.\n\nAt the time of course this gave me a brief moment of pause, but it's par for the course in that world. Can't be helped. I had resigned her to the annals of people I once knew so its fun and interesting to see her in real life and catch up. The other customers and two salarymen I brought with me are bewildered, assuming we used to be a romantic couple, we quickly change the subject. She tells me she works shifts Sunday and Thursday so I make a note to catch up with her one on one at some point in the future.\n\nI also run into my good friends Tim and James there with a gaggle of new JETs in their twenties, still excited to have finally arrived in Japan. Tim is a chemical engineer and James is researching autonomous vehicle AI at Tohoku university. Both are out to socialize, learn Japanese, meet girls, and do young guy stuff. I try to meet all of the JET's and introduce myself.\n\nWe order high balls. The salarymen are surprised that everyone knows me. I ask them more about their individual situations, what they do at their companies. They're both well-educated so I absorb a handful of new vocab and new cultural knowledge from the conversation. We have a few more drinks, I introduce them to the people around me. They say the want to go to maybe one more place and then maybe call it a night.\n\nI tell them that there's a world-class \"authentic bar\" about a minute away. The bartender is an absolute demon, and strawberries are in season. You're going to have the best strawberry cocktail of your life.\n\nThe three of us settle up and head to the bar. As usual Kurihara-san (the demon bartender) is friendly and chatty. We all ask for some kind of strawberry concoction, leaving the details to him. The decor, vibe, and level of skill is worthy of it's own Netflix documentary. Watching him go, polishing ice, washing it, arranging ingredients, pouring out measures, is watching a master at work. And the finished product perfect in flavour and texture. Thick, velvety, very strawberry, you can barely taste the [[Alcohol]] from the champagne.\n\nWe talk more and the salarymen ask me what's the weirdest place I've been to is in Sendai. I tell them they wouldn't believe me, but I'll try to explain.\n\nThere's a very high-end snack bar in kokubuncho, it doesn't show up on maps. It's run by a 42-year old mama who wears a kimono, sings old songs on the karaoke machine and occasionally plays the shamisen. She's known for her beauty and hospitality. However her husband died a few years ago, and her boyfriend (who she didn't actually stop seeing while married) passed away a few months after that. A third man in her life passed away within the same year. Her snack is bar is dark, with expensive whiskeys, rare blended shochus and kokubuncho yakuza and company directors (line is blurry there) as her customers.\n\nThey're intrigued, or perhaps just have a morbid curiosity. They no longer want to go home. They ask me how I know about this place and I tell them it's a long story (it's a very long story, involving a whole other cast of characters). The bar is literally called \"the den of evil\".\n\nWhat I don't tell them is that the mama tells that story openly and also has a habit of taking home her customers, as a handful of people I took there have reported back to me. Good for her I think, but her stories and the nonchalantness with which she tells them scare me.\n\nWe walk over to her bar in kokubuncho and she greets me at the door. She's not in a kimono, but I remember she told me it's because her excema was playing up. I ask about that and after her six-year old daughter, who she keeps in a night nursery while she works (very common set up for night workers who are also mothers).\n\nOnce we're in I notice the company owner of a local izakaya chain with an account manager from one of the two big alcohhol distributors sitting in a box seat. The izakaya shacho is Jabba-the-hutt fat, smoking a fat cigar wearing a polo shirt looking like an enormous smoky marshmallow. I go over and greet them. I can't remember what happened but it's likely we went out drinking at one point, maybe I introduced him to this snack? He has an expensive bottle of champagne at his table. Once the salarymen and I are sat at the counter, Jabba gestures to the mama to pour us a glass each of the nice champagne.\n\nI am completely tone-deaf but I decide to sing some Aerosmith and ドライフラワー which I'm into in the moment. The salarymen are amazed by this place but are now completely drunk, so we decide to leave in an hour.\n\nGuy sitting directly to my left is Sasaki san. He starts talking to me. He's in his early, maybe mid sixties. It turns out he is my ex-wife's next door neighbour. I buy him a drink and apologise for my youngest screaming and crying so much. He says not to worry, he misses the sounds of kids running around.\n\nThe original two salarymen are fully cooked, decide to leave early. They thank me for a great night, I tell them to be safe on the way home. Sasaki-san says he has one more venue left in him for the night, maybe a hostess club, and do I have any suggestions? I laugh. Sure, I can think of a few places.\n\nWe leave the den of evil and head a bit further down Kokubuncho-dori. Some of the experienced kyacchi greet me and ask me what I'm up to tonight. We know each other by name at this point. I've drunk with a handful of them at very sketchy places over the years.\n\nThe club I'm going to take him to is on the second floor of the building in front of us. The elevator opens onto a dark entrance, red velvet on the walls. The DJ is playing \"I Feel it Coming\" by The Weeknd. The doorman greets me by name and asks if it'll be the same as usual. I tell him yes please.\n\nAfter checking over the radio the doorman escorts us to our our seat. The walk to our seats is like a the one-shot walk through scene in goodfellas. The girls waiting in the corridor door nod/bow in my direction while fidgeting with their phones. The store head, a big former judo guy who's known me for years bows deep and gestures to the main floor. It's a busy night, lots of customers notice me walk in, a one or two of them know my face. Mostly they're still just surprised that a foreigner visits a place like this.\n\nWe ask for shochu on the rocks and one of the floor staff makes it for us. The girl I nominated, Hanako, is set here, so I don't really get a choice in the matter unless I make a point of it. A few minutes later a couple of girls I don't know are brought to our table. I'm pretty drunk, and Sasaki-san is pretty wasted too, but he's still talking to the girls and having a good time.\n\nA few moments later, Hanako is brought over to our table and one of the other girls leaves. Hanako is 27. The easiest way to describe Hanako is that she's like a Japanese Ariana Grande. Stunningly beautiful but also offensively good at her job. In a club of about forty girls she consistently takes a top 4 spot in the revenue/point rankings while still only working three or four nights a week, and balancing a day job. She's also a law-school graduate.\n\nSasaki-san is busy talking to his girl who gets changed out every twenty minutes. Hanako is happy to see me as usual. She's vaping while keeping a keen eye on our drinks. One of the best things about Hanako is she's a complete hardass on everyone she works with to make sure her customers have not a single hiccup in service, the girl makes the trains run on time. I'd been seeing her at this club for maybe two years.\n\nI try to be a good listener and give people as much room to talk as possible, but she is excellent at doing the same to me, paraphrasing what I say, using _active listening_ to get me to verbalise things I didn't even know I wanted to verbalise. The only times I do get her to talk about herself, she talks primarily about her obsessive addiction to Monster Hunter. We also talk a lot about health and fitness, I'd say 80% of our recent conversations centre on things I learned listening to the Huberman Lab podcast. While she's filling up my eighth glass of shochu. It is what it is.\n\nThe DJ is great. 90s hip-hop, lots of 2Pac and Biggie, modern pop too, it's like he is in my on repeat playlist. After an hour I decide I'm tired and I'm ready to go home. We settle up and the girls see us off at the elevator. Sasaki-san decides to go home so I wave goodbye to him. I walk back down Kokubuncho street on the way back to my place.\n\nAs I'm approaching the same building as the den of evil, I notice Tim and James in line at a new club that opened recently (by club I mean like, drinks and music and dancing, not hostess club). They say I should join them. I tell them I'm too old for that kind of thing, but I'll wait with them in line a bit. I tell them they should start talking to some of the groups in front/behind them. They're too shy to do this, so I start talking to those groups, and then mix them in with Tim and James so everyone is having a good time.\n\nAs we get to the door of the club I'm about to take off, when out of somewhere a somewhat rotund older Japanese guy in a baseball cap grabs my collar and starts shouting something at me in heavy Sendai-ben. I am startled and my fight-or-flight response goes into overdrive.\n\nI've been trying recently to get better at emotional regulation. I know in these situations, the best outcomes happen when I use my rational brain, my prefrontal-cortex, but for that part of me to come to the fore I've got to a) at least be aware of my biological response to the situation and b) quiet my first, ego-driven response. However, with this much [[Alcohol]] in me, my pre-frontal cortex being depressed, it was difficult to get there.\n\nBut I try. My \"inner child\" sent up the bat signal to my rational self, asking for help. I tried to stay calm. First I strip his grip to get me out of immediate danger. Then I take stock of the situation.\n\nTo guys right was a younger guy, covered in tattoos holding guys wallet and bag. All gucci. I felt guys hands in mine and noticed something odd. He had no pinky or ring fingers on either hand. LV sunglasses and irezumi peaking up out of his t-shirt.\n\nAt that point my memory kicks in.\n\n\"Hey, we've met before. You go that girls bar, the Honeybee Club right?\" I ask, trying to keep my voice steady.\n\n\"Yeah I remember you! You're friends with Genki-san right?\" he asks, his face cracking a smile.\n\nWe chat for a bit. He was going into the same club as Tim and James but didn't have to wait the line. I tell him these two are my friends so let's all try to have fun.\n\nJust then a small woman in a kimono in her 80s shuffles past.\n\n\"Seiji, did I just see you put your hands on Ali-san?\" she asks.\n\nThe old man sobers up immediately.\n\n\"Do you know him?\" he asks the lady, in suddenly very measured Japanese.\n\n\"Yes. He's a member and an important customer\" she says, looking directly at him.\n\n\"I'm very sorry. Please accept my apologies\" he says to her as she walked on.\n\nShe looks over at me briefly and I bow deep.\n\n\"How the hell do you know Retsuko-mama?\" he asks, astonished.\n\n\"It's a long story\" I respond.\n\nRetsuko-mama is the aforementioned \"last boss\" of Kokubuncho. Politicians curry favour with her, she is the \"fixer\" behind the scenes and no big deals get done in [[Sendai]] without her knowing about them. Her exploits and wealth are of legend. Godmother, don, powerbroker, call her what you will, but a good business card to have in your wallet, let's put it that way.\n\nMy heart is still racing at this point and sit down in front of a convenience store for a moment to catch my breath. I don't really enjoy fighty situations, but think at the moment that this is going to be one hell of a story, how could anyone believe this?\n\nI check my phone and Hanako sent me a quick thank you note. I send her a note back thanking her again for today. I tell her a fun thing just happened, I'll tell her about it next time.\n\nJust then I get a text from Kaede. I'm both happy that she's contacting me and also tired thinking about what the next six hours are going to be like, especially if she's had a lot to drink. She says she's just finishing up work and wants to hang out and maybe stay over at mine tonight.\n\nI wait for a bit but I get no response from her, so go to a late-night tonkotsu ramen place. It's a bit rowdy near the entrance, someone just threw up. I go inside and get my tonkotsu ramen. While I'm there Kaede texts me and asks me to wait around until 3am because one of her customers bought some champagne and she has to go on an after with them.\n\nI say OK, but decide I'll head back to mine first and maybe fall asleep. About 90m later she calls me, she's very drunk and clearly not well. I come back to Kokubuncho street and meet her walking in the opposite direction. She has a miserable look on her face, her makeup is smeared as though she's been crying, and there's a red stain on her all-white top.\n\nShe's not a very huggy girl but I decide to hug her anyway and she starts crying. I take my coat off and drape it on her shoulders, grab her bag, and walk her back to my place. It turns out she had a particularly bad group of customers on the after who went out of their way to make fun of her for being a dumb, ugly, \"countryside hostess\", and one of them went so far as to deliberately spill Tabasco over her clothes.\n\n(For the record she's one of the prettiest girls I've ever met both inside and outside of her club, and is very intelligent, creative, and bright.)\n\nWe go back to my place, we put her clothes in the wash and she wears things she pulls out of my closet. She tells me all about what happened, and manage to get back into good spirits. We sing some disney songs. We're both too drunk to have sex but try anyway. The result is a somewhat sloppy but otherwise enjoyable mess. After we go out onto my balcony, sipping chu-hais and talking for the next four hours as we watch the sun come up.\n\nWhen I wake up the next day she's gone. Did I imagine her? I have a terrible but serviceable hangover, but not much energy to do anything else. What a bonkers night, how did that happen?\n\n***\n\nSounds unbelievable? Dear reader, this is not a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, **it's a Tuesday**. Or maybe this sort of night is normal for you, I don't know. I have no frame of reference.\n\n## [[Sendai]] at night as a Rogue-like\n\nI never played Rogue itself but I've played a couple of modern Rogue-likes, like _Dead Cells _and _Hades. _You play the same levels from the start on each \"run\" of the game. In modern games like this, each run allows you to take some items, experience, skills into the next run. Rooms or enemies may be placed differently each time, but you get to know more of the characters as you progress further into the game on each run. And there are items, prizes, high scores to be attained, and challenges to overcome and skills to learn.\n\nThat, is what a night out in [[Sendai]] is like to me. Each time I go out I might go over familiar territory or I might explore new dungeons. All types of challenges might be thrown my way that I have to overcome, learning something about myself in the process. I get to use and improve my Japanese social ability. Old characters rotate in and out, I discover new connections, and new side-quests appear. Gaining some skill and recognition is a huge ego boost.\n\nBut like any Rogue-like you spend hundreds of hours of your life in, a point comes when you look at the hours played counter and ask yourself, isn't this just about enough? There are a few counterarguments:\n- I'm having an incredible amount of fun. I don't know anyone that is having as much fun in Japan as I am. And it is getting more fun on each run, not less.\n- I am improving, both in Japanese conversational ability and ability to network, at an increasingly rapid rate. I've always been a relatively good networker but my skills are much tighter and more refined after these past few years.\n\nThere isn't much I can point to as an achievement that's come out of all of this. Part of me wanted to make [[Sendai]] more used to foreigners and foreigners more used to Sendai. So I used my social ability, connections, etc to start [[Sendai]][ International Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/sendai-international-meetups-the-new-era/), an international exchange event that me and a friend have worked up to getting a regular attendance of about fifty people, which for [[Sendai]] is not insignificant.\n\nThis allows me to bring together a lot of the characters I've met and take them to a lot of the places I've discovered. I also like that I've been able to introduce people to each other and create friendships and romantic engagements, if not relationships.\n\nBut there are three problems that playing this particular Rogue-like has brought into my life that are getting in the way of other things:\n- [[Alcohol]] consumption. I don't like drinking alone so I'm not sure that I'm physically addicted to alcohol, but it's become a very, very regular fixture in my life. I should probably drink less.\n- Sex addiction. Not much more to say about that, it is what it is. Obviously very fun and not sure I'm going to stop, but it's definitely a distraction.\n- Time and energy. Dealing with all of these adventures takes a lot out of your physically, and just recovering from hangovers leaves very little time for basically anything else.\n\nRecent events have made me question how much many more runs I have left in me. I haven't made any decisions yet but I'm definitely sitting and thinking about whether it may be it's time for a new season.\n\n## Planet-scale success\n\nIt's March 2023 and I'm very unemployed. Three things happened:\n- SVB Bank something something. I think the correct term is \"imploded\" but I don't have the knowledge to speak about this intelligently.\n- OpenAI unleashed ChatGPT, sending many programmers and tech leadership people into an existential crisis.\n- There were tens of thousands of layoffs in bigtech, flooding the market with senior engineering talent\n\nI'm on OK senior Ruby on Rails developer, and I work freelance, in Japan. However, I had stopped networking entirely since Happy Bear Software wrapped up, so I have no options in front of me. I briefly attempted a cold-emailing campaign but decided that I'll just stick to what I do best: networking, starting with my friends back in London.\n\nI got back in touch with very many people, getting on zoom calls and it was great to be able to talk shop with people in English. It was also good to see where everyone had got to in their careers after all this time.\n\nAs a part of this an old friend suggested visiting him in Tokyo. He, like an unnamed member of my family, is professionally successful on a planet-wide scale. But having a conversation with either of these two people throws into sharp relief what I might have achieved had I focused more on creating things.\n\nAnd it's not just those two. Any cursory glance through Indie Hackers podcast guest list or even other people I've been on calls with over the past few weeks and you have countless examples of people with a similar professional background as me going on to attain enviable levels of success. This all hit hard when after my conversation with my good friend in Tokyo.\n\nFor now, I need to put money in the bank somehow and finding new work via networking is the only way I know how to do that. And whatever I do next will involve me being sociable and networking and collaborating with people.\n\nThere will be more speed-runs through [[Sendai]] and many adventures to come, but after spending time with so many monstrously successful people, I think it's time for me to make a good attempt at other things. At goals and dreams I've neglected for almost twenty years. Part of me was worried that these things would never happen for me, but another part of me thinks that maybe everything happened the way it did for a reason.\n\n#### Footnotes\n\n_[1]: One day buy me a drink and I will regale you with some anecdotes to the contrary._","cwd":"/Users/najafali/.openclaw/workspace"},"isError":false,"timestamp":1769911879208}}

Trying to operate with some semblance of normalcy in a Japanese company, the values both alien and reasonable at once. 6pm rolled around and it was time for Ikemoto sans party.\n\nI put on a jacket and a scarf and went downstairs, across from my place. I met eyes with Airi, she was pretty and pleasant as usual, always well put together but vaguely awkward. Airi ran a small seven-seater whiskey bar where I'd met Ikemoto-san. Ikemoto was in his late 60s, a surfer, who'd just sold his company for many millions of moneydollars, and tonight was his big send-off.\n\nWe tried to get in to the venue but were told to come back at exactly 6pm, so we walked back to the covered shopping arcade outside my flat. A few other guests turned up. It felt slightly awkward because it was beginning to look like Airi and I were \"together\" together, a rumour neither of us would benefit from. I would devour Airi given half the chance, but we have too many people in common and any hint of a relationship would just cause chaos and scandal. \n\nThat and there's another girl still there lurking in the depths of my heart, someone I can't shake off, wait out, or drink away the memory of. There's no amount of drinking, fucking, or meditating to get that one out of my system.\n\nWe got in at 6pm with twenty of Ikemoto-sans friends. They were all rough and ready, construction guys with calloused hands and gruff voices, not saying much to each other, just sitting around looking mean. It would transpire that they were all feeling as awkward and nervous as I was sitting next to Airi.\n\nIkemoto-san got Airi up to pour a bottle onto the champagne tower, things were getting underway. We were surrounded by twenty-year-old girls in oiran (courtesan) style kimono, it was cheap and cheerful. We were in bunka yokocho, one of the oldest drinking alleys in Sendai. He ordered very expensive sushi for everyone from a traditional little place across the street.\n\nI went downstairs at the same time as Airi and deliberately sat further away from her as were too visibly \"together\" in the evening so far. She sat awkwardly for a while but a lady that looks like that doesn't stay alone for long in a small building filled with Japanese men in their 40s.\n\nThe oiran girls were all pretty, pleasant to talk to, laughed easily at my jokes. Somehow I managed to convince Mario to take the whole group to Aladdin, a place in the same group with a burlesque show. We got in separate taxis and headed to Tachimachi.\n\n---\n\nThe girl fell on Ikemoto and pretend rode him in cowgirl, the music was some sort trap persian belly dancing remix turned up. Ikemoto was having the time of his life.\n\nI'd been sober for about a month and was trying to temper my nicotine addiction with Rubiks cube solves. I was somehow maintaining a conversation with a tall Italian girl sitting next to me, student at Tohoku university. We talked a lot about what brought her to Japan, some modelling she'd been doing with a local agency, and how much fun she's having working in the night world.\n\nI needed the toilet. This took me past the main floor and dance area. The toilet had a fun poster on the wall, a size chart with commentary on ranges, ranging from \"an exit for liquid\" to \"you are a horse\".\n\nI washed my hands and stepped out of the mens room."}],"details":{"status":"completed","exitCode":0,"durationMs":9,"aggregated":"Mika-san was spinning around the pole, twenty feet off the ground at an impossible angle, an art deco fresco behind her.

Trying to operate with some semblance of normalcy in a Japanese company, the values both alien and reasonable at once. 6pm rolled around and it was time for Ikemoto sans party.\n\nI put on a jacket and a scarf and went downstairs, across from my place. I met eyes with Airi, she was pretty and pleasant as usual, always well put together but vaguely awkward. Airi ran a small seven-seater whiskey bar where I'd met Ikemoto-san. Ikemoto was in his late 60s, a surfer, who'd just sold his company for many millions of moneydollars, and tonight was his big send-off.\n\nWe tried to get in to the venue but were told to come back at exactly 6pm, so we walked back to the covered shopping arcade outside my flat. A few other guests turned up. It felt slightly awkward because it was beginning to look like Airi and I were \"together\" together, a rumour neither of us would benefit from. I would devour Airi given half the chance, but we have too many people in common and any hint of a relationship would just cause chaos and scandal. \n\nThat and there's another girl still there lurking in the depths of my heart, someone I can't shake off, wait out, or drink away the memory of. There's no amount of drinking, fucking, or meditating to get that one out of my system.\n\nWe got in at 6pm with twenty of Ikemoto-sans friends. They were all rough and ready, construction guys with calloused hands and gruff voices, not saying much to each other, just sitting around looking mean. It would transpire that they were all feeling as awkward and nervous as I was sitting next to Airi.\n\nIkemoto-san got Airi up to pour a bottle onto the champagne tower, things were getting underway. We were surrounded by twenty-year-old girls in oiran (courtesan) style kimono, it was cheap and cheerful. We were in bunka yokocho, one of the oldest drinking alleys in Sendai. He ordered very expensive sushi for everyone from a traditional little place across the street.\n\nI went downstairs at the same time as Airi and deliberately sat further away from her as were too visibly \"together\" in the evening so far. She sat awkwardly for a while but a lady that looks like that doesn't stay alone for long in a small building filled with Japanese men in their 40s.\n\nThe oiran girls were all pretty, pleasant to talk to, laughed easily at my jokes. Somehow I managed to convince Mario to take the whole group to Aladdin, a place in the same group with a burlesque show. We got in separate taxis and headed to Tachimachi.\n\n---\n\nThe girl fell on Ikemoto and pretend rode him in cowgirl, the music was some sort trap persian belly dancing remix turned up. Ikemoto was having the time of his life.\n\nI'd been sober for about a month and was trying to temper my nicotine addiction with Rubiks cube solves. I was somehow maintaining a conversation with a tall Italian girl sitting next to me, student at Tohoku university. We talked a lot about what brought her to Japan, some modelling she'd been doing with a local agency, and how much fun she's having working in the night world.\n\nI needed the toilet. This took me past the main floor and dance area. The toilet had a fun poster on the wall, a size chart with commentary on ranges, ranging from \"an exit for liquid\" to \"you are a horse\".\n\nI washed my hands and stepped out of the mens room.","cwd":"/Users/najafali/.openclaw/workspace"},"isError":false,"timestamp":1769911879217}}

Overview & Geography\n\nAli lives directly adjacent to the yokochos in central Sendai. His apartment is on a shopping arcade (Ichibancho), and stepping straight across the arcade puts him in front of **Bunka Yokocho** and **Iroha Yokocho**. He describes them as \"picturesque Japanese side-streets packed with tiny little bars and restaurants that can only fit seven or eight people\" with **around 370 establishments** in total. From his window he can see the arcade canopy and the tin roofs of the yokochos.\n\n**Kokubuncho** (国分町) is about a 7-minute walk further up the arcade — the central entertainment district with hostess clubs, girls bars, snack bars, and regular drinking spots.\n\n**Sources:**\n- `reflect-import/.../Speed-running Sendai.md` (detailed geographic walkthrough)\n- `Something Else.md` (mermaid diagram mapping Ali → Bunka Yokocho, Kokubuncho, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Here's what I found and wrote up:\n\n**Summary written to:** `research/yokocho-vault-mentions.md`\n\n**Key findings across ~40 matching files:**\n\n- **Iroha Yokocho & Bunka Yokocho** are the core yokochos — Ali lives directly adjacent (his building, City House 506, is steps away). He estimates **2,340+ hours** spent socializing there over 5 years.\n- **~370 establishments** in the yokochos total, per Ali's count.\n- **17+ named venues** identified in the yokochos including Tori Yoshi (yakitori institution with yakuza origins), teeny...i (Airi's whisky bar), The Steamers, Jaco, Ittaku, 中吉, Daruma, Jodan Sakaba, and more.\n- **Kokubuncho** (国分町) is the larger entertainment district — hostess clubs, snack bars, girls bars. Ali knows the street touts by name and has connections up to \"Retsuko-mama,\" the legendary political fixer.\n- **Major essays** — \"Speed-running Sendai\" and \"Another day in my strange life in Japan\" are rich narrative pieces centered on yokocho life, including post-WWII history (Matsuo-gumi yakuza establishing Iroha-yokocho).\n- **Memoir project** — yokochos are a central setting across all three acts.\n- **Japan at Night tour business** — yokochos are the backbone of the tour, with cash/card issues noted as a practical concern.\n- **Dream bar** — Ali has drafted a menu for a hypothetical yokocho drinkery (omelettes, roast potatoes, marmite toast, nihari-style curry)."}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":1,"output":420,"cacheRead":40897,"cacheWrite":3771,"totalTokens":45089,"cost":{"input":0.000005,"output":0.0105,"cacheRead":0.020448499999999998,"cacheWrite":0.02356875,"total":0.054522249999999994}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1769911972979}}
