I wanted to get a head start on the day so I splashed some cold water on my face, put my glasses on and sat at my terminal.\n\nYesterday was a successful programming day. There were some fundamental problems with the way I was implementing this data sync, I hadn't thought through a handful of edge cases and so I was refactoring code I had just written. I broke a few tests, fixed a few tests, and then ran some end-to-end acceptance tests and they worked on the first or second try. It felt good to be good at something, the code flowed freely and worked like I expected it to. So today the morning meeting with the client went well. We went through a few ideas for other features for me to work on later, and chatted about AI and movies.\n\nIt was a light meeting day at my day job, just my one-to-one with my boss where we complained a lot about the company. The QA team were having problems with the Rahul firing, and I ran some ideas past my boss about trying to get one of our backend engineers to take the initiative on a major refactor that's about four years too late. Mariko appeared during the meeting, treading gently into my office. She would later tell me she was being careful so as to not disturb me on the off chance that I was jerking off. I thought that was considerate of her, but she could have just texted me first.\n\nI did a few light bits of work after the 1:1, giving GitHub access to some engineers, wrote some documentation, and checked in with a few people about a few situations. Then Mariko and I decided to step out for lunch.\n\nI'm a big fan of Kenji Alt. Lopez's blog on Serious Eats, and his recipe book The Food Lab has been my bible for over a decade. His roast potatoes are a revelation. But recently at The Steamers, Masumi has made roast potatoes to rival those of Kenji's. They are perfect. Soft on the inside, crispy and golden on the outside, with roasted garlic cloves and rosemary, and just enough salt. Until I met Masumi, I thought that Japanese people didn't have any idea what the fuck they were doing with potatoes (apart from one important example that we'll get to later). And I wanted Mariko to eat these potatoes. So I walked us in that direction. She made a face about going to The Steamers, she didn't like the smoke, but I insisted.\n\nWhen we got there it was lunch hours and Masumi was not serving roast potatoes, so we gave up on that for today.\n\nOne thing that Mariko and I find amusing is restaurants that play music that are completely inappropriate for the theme. In Sendai Morning Market there's an underground Japanese restaurant that has really good seafood, but we went there once and they were playing Temperature by Sean Paul. Hence forth it was called the Sean Paul place. She felt like going to the Sean Paul restaurant, so we walked through Asaichi and had a nice chirashi-zushi with tonjiru and pickles.\n\nOn the way back I picked up a kilo of shank meat and a big bag of dry soybeans from the market. I was animated, explaining Mary Shellys Frankenstein as one of the first works of science fiction in modern Western literature, and that I was particularly pleased with the new rendition by Guillermo Del Toro starring Oscar Isaacs. There was a confusing discussion after that about the other Del Toro, and I mentioned that I was a fan of Benicio as well, especially in the slow burn crime thriller Reptile that also stars Justin Timberlake. This lead to a discussion about what \"slow burn\" means. It was a fun conversation, for me at least.\n\nWe got back to my home office, I started puffing away on my iqos and doing more writing and thinking. I thought it might be nice to go see my boys this evening. They still had my gancube and I felt a bit rusty on the cube after a few weeks off. I also wanted to give Mamiko child support for the month. Mariko fell asleep on the sofa while watching The Morning Show.\n\nThe Sendai Rinri Houjin kai is something between The Rotary Club and the Freemasons, and Mariko had a little event with them in the evening from 18:00, so she asked me to wake her up by 17:30.\n\nI did some more typing and thinking. I made some notes about ongoing issues at Givery and made my rounds on Jira and GitHub for the day. Then I wrote a bit of documentation for the freelance code that I had written the day before. I was particularly proud of some of the reusable components that fell out of the work, so writing them up was good fun.\n\nI've also been thinking about doing my own version of the Quentin Detest Fest this weekend. I conceptualised it as descending into Dante's circles, with disappointments and mistakes on the outside of the circle, negative patterns of behaviour one layer in, conceptualised as traits one layer deeper with negative emotions and thought patterns clustered around then, and fundamental, deeply maladaptive truths clustered in the centre. Heavy work!\n\nAt 17:33 I walked over to the sofa, cupped Mariko's face and kissed her on the forehead.\n\n\"Wake up you big dohnut\" I said.\n\n\"Hnngf OK\" she said.\n\n\"I haven't seen Sakurai daddy in a while, so I want to drop by today\" I said.\n\n\"He'll be sad about that, you should go see him\" she said.\n\nWe left together, I wanted to get out some money and buy some smokes from the the Family Mart and said goodbye to her there, she was walking up to Kotodai Koen.\n\nI walked into the side alleys, Yabe Sakaba, and daddy poured me a soda and lemon, and we talked about nothing in particular. He asked about how work was going, told me some funny stories about some other tour guide. I asked after mummy. He wanted me to come to their Christmas party on the 24th, apparently he'd bought a ready-made turkey and was confused about how to serve it. He also wanted to know if I might be spending the 24th with my boys and I said I'd be in touch to figure it out. He showed me some very old faded black-and-white photos of him and his friends as a child at the beach. I took a phot of it and sent it to Mariko. I got up to leave, asked him to let me pay him some money and he told me to fuck off, so I laughed and waved goodbye, pushing aside the noren and sliding the door closed behind me.\n\nI was hungry so decided I was getting my potatoes, so went into The Steamers and had a coffee and potatoes while smoking a few cigarettes and chatting with Masumi. She said she really liked the girl I brought there on Sunday, Aya-chan.\n\n\"She seemed really bright. Super young though.\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah she's a nice girl, she's OK\" I said, taking a drag on my cigarette.\n\nI paused to think.\n\n\"But she's not someone I'm going to fall in love with. I kinda want to fall in love again soon, just for the fun of it\" I said.\n\n\"So she's not really your type?\" asked Masumi.\n\n\"She's good fun. It may seem shallow, but it's about looks\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, you like girls with a bit more spice to them. Maybe a bit older\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah, yes, about 26 to around thirty four seems about just right. Girls that are cute but have their look put together, they're cute but they're trying to be pretty\" I said.\n\n\"You just want Kana back\" she said.\n\n\"Guilty as charged\" I said. \"I was quite fond of her.\"\n\nThis gave me pause. It touched a deep wound. I changed the subject, made some jokes about something, we laughed a lot.\n\nI texted Mamiko that I want to come over and drop off the child support money, asked if it was OK to stop by. She took a minute to respond with just one word \"Anytime\".\n\nI went home to pick up the money then hopped into a taxi from outside of Fujisaki. The taxi driver was calm, professional, with a clear voice and zero drama. This is actually quite rare, and I appreciated. I thought about whether I'd still be able to solve the cube after such a long break.\n\nTwenty years ago when I was much younger, more ambitious, and completely oblivious to what the world had in store for me, I met Mamiko in Miyako in Iwate prefecture, my JET placement, a small coastal town in the cold dark north of Japan. After a summer romance we began a difficult marriage, both of us incapable of handling our own or each others emotions. After ten years in the UK and two children, we eventually moved back to Japan in 2018, separated and divorced a few years later.\n\nThe house was calm. Ryu was in the bath, Kei was playing Roblox on an IPad he had just got. I was happy to see him. Mamiko was calm and unagitated, and talking playfully with Kei, him ignoring her for the screen but answering with a few funny well-timed comments and puns. Mamiko gave me an update about how they were both doing. She was somewhere between friendly and neutral today, and I was glad that no one was having an emotional outburst. She was unsure about her parenting decisions, and I reassured her that she was doing a great job.\n\nI found my gancube on the coffee table, it had some kind of gunk on it which I was surprised about. Apparently Kei had been playing with it before/after eating so I teased him a little for gunking it up. I scruffed up his hair a bit as he explained everything happening in Roblox to me. I sat next to him and saw if I could solve my cube. The action was somehow gunked up as well, the movement a lot more clunky than I remembered it a week ago. I definitely remembered my beginner method algorithms which felt good. I continued solving it again and again while I chatted with him and Mamiko he played Roblox.\n\nRyu emerged from the shower, towering over us. What was once a small, pig-nosed baby that I could easily carry around on one forearm was now an awkward, gangly pre-teen, messy hair and bumfluff on his upper lip. I got up and pushed him around, gave him an awkward hug, and asked after him. He responded in grunts, as was his way recently. I smiled and told him to text me sometimes.\n\nHe hung around in front of the heater, watched Kei play Roblox, then went to the futon in the back room behind the living room and played with his phone. I went over to the futon and asked him a few questions, more grunts. I was happy for the time with him. I said I want to watch the new Frankenstein movie with him and said we should do that next time, and did a few more solves on my cube. I talked to Mamiko a little more, then called my taxi.\n\nBack in Iroha Yokocho I walked around trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I was a bit restless and hungry. The yokochos were quiet, and Tori Yoshi was quiet, with a group of three salaryman at the end of the counter and no one else in the shop, so I thought it might be a good chance to show face have a relaxed meal, encompassing the jagamaru.\n\nThe mama, a lady approaching seventy, has been hard of hearing these past few years, so I had to speak up to make my order. She was also a bit funny and witty, and we had a nice rapport. I ordered my jagamaru, a potato cooked in foil low and slow with hokkaido butter for an hour, and ordered liver, wings and negima and started working on a non-alcoholic beer. I was calm and relaxed.\n\nAfter the second world war, Iroha-yokocho emerged as two streets, one a market with some goods prohibited by the occupation, the other with a row of restaurants and drinky bars. The area was administered and supported by the Matsuo-gumi Yakuza group, by their oyabun and a young captain that had made a name for himself by establishing the market. 35 years ago that captain or _wakagashira_ started a yakitori restaurant on the northern Aoba-dori side alley, the place was called Tori Yoshi. Tori Yoshi is now an _institution_ in Sendai, one of the most storied yakitori restaurants we have.\n\nI just refered to him as _Oyakata_ as I never thought to call him anything else. He was surly and gruff at the grill, but occasionally warm and smily with me. I'd often the see the two of them dressed very well out on the town together, and always teased them for being out too late on a school night.\n\nThe mama shouted my order down to the Oyakata and he went to work on my potato. I anticipated my chicken with glee. This was going to be great, I had the place mostly to myself.\n\nI got about one stick in before to my left I looked out the door, and met eyes with a tourist that gingerly working up the courage to enter the store. She was an American lady, walked right in, and asked for the menu in English. The mama looked at her with confusion.\n\nI gestured to the menu myself and the lady pulled out some kind of AR translation app. Stupidly, I offered to help with the menu.\n\n\"Do they have any pescatarian or vegetarian options here?\" she asked me.\n\n\"No, this is a famous chicken restaurant\" I replied, bewildered.\n\n\"Well could you just ask her to rustle up like a vegetable stir fry with some rice or something?\" she asked.\n\n\"That would be very awkward, I'm not going to do that.\" I said, now somewhat agitated.\n\nHer husband came in.\n\n\"Hey, what can we have on the menu that's vegetarian?\" he asked me.\n\n\"It's going to be difficult to find anything vegetarian here\" I said.\n\n\"OK well what do you recommend here?\" he asked.\n\n\"This is a yakitori restaurant, so chicken\" I said.\n\n\"OK well can you just order one stick each for us?\" he said.\n\n\"OK, the options are heart, gizzard, negima...\" I started.\n\n\"Yeah just anything you recommend\" he said, cutting me off.\n\nI was getting annoyed. I had been looking forward to a quiet meal, just me and the mama and the Oyakata. Now I was in full tour-guide mode, for free, but I knew there would be more confusion if I wasn't there. Either way I was locked in for at least another forty minutes waiting for my jagamaru.\n\nThe couple sat to my left. As all of this was happening, two young men came into the restaurant, sat to my right, and started perusing the menu.\n\nThe mama told me that they have a minimum three sticks policy which I relayed to couple. They said they're full and can't have that much, which I relayed to the mama. Then we all just looked at each other awkwardly. What a fucking mess.\n\nThe couple wouldn't leave, so the mama said she would speak to the Oyakata, who just gruffed gruffly at her. She agreed to one stick each. Predictably the couple were also surprised at the table charge, and the cabbage and tofu that came out, complaining that they didn't order it.\n\nEventually things calmed down, I helped them order plum wine. Then the two soft-spoken gentlemen to my right jumped in with broken English, saying that they could use some help ordering too. They were from Indonesia and Taiwan respectively, visiting Tohoku university for a conference on fluid dynamics. I joked that that sounded hard, enjoy your hard maths life, to which they offered resigned chuckles.\n\nThe Oyakata and the mama had an argument about the violation of the three-stick rule, and everything came out in a strange order. My jagamaru was a big event, and everyone stared at it. I told them seriously not to stare at my jagamaru, barely concealing my frustration with a paper-thin layer of humour, as I attempted to tuck into it while diffusing misunderstandings both to my left and my right.\n\nThe Oyakata apologised to the mama for losing his temper and I felt this was quite wholesome.\n\n---\n\nThree or four years ago I was in Jaco, a shochu bar in the Yokochos. The master was playing _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_ muted on a small TV at the end of the bar, The Beatles *Norweigan Wood* on the sound system, and I was drinking a fruity wheat shochu while enjoying some goya champuru. Whisps of eggy egg with bitter strands of goya and a magical chilli oil that tasted alcoholic.\n\nNext to me sat Shuko, a portly Japanese lady who had found me on Hello Talk. She was very keen to talk about sex. For some reason she was under the impression that I was \"Latin\", and so was very excited to tell me that she recently had sex with a Latin guy, and said they move differently during sex. I congratulated her. The longer she spoke the more quickly I wanted to exit the room.\n\nShe was very touchy, and this annoyed me further. I paid my bill and attempted to leave the small seven-seater bar. She said she wanted to tell me a secret and to lean in. Not knowing any better, I leaned in on my right side, and I felt a cold soggy tongue in my ear. I felt ill. I recoiled in terror.\n\nI tried to leave again, and she blocked the exit with her arm. I swung under and out of the door and left her to it. She ran out of the bar calling after me, and I ran away.\n\nI'm not a superstitious person, I don't believe in ghosts or demons, but here's what happened. Over the next few months, I began to slowly lose hearing in my right ear. I didn't know why. I thought that perhaps I was going deaf, so I tried to enjoy classical music, listening to a lot of Liszt and Debussy, just in case my hearing was going for good. I'd been putting off going to the ENT out of fear of it becoming real.\n\nEventually I went, and he took a look at my ears.\n\nMy left side where I could hear was clean.\n\nHe took one look at my right side and jumped back in surprise.\n\n\"Ali-san, this is magnificent. I've never seen a specimen like this.\" he said.\n\n\"Is that good news or bad news?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh it's fine, we can clean this up right now, it might be a bit uncomfortable but your ears are fine.\" he said chippily.\n\nThe young doctor called over a nurse who quickly appeared with some sort of suction tool on wheels, along with an array of implements for some sort of physical medical work.\n\nHe told me to sit back and try to relax as he went to work.\n\nHe did his thing, and it indeed felt a bit uncomfortable. The longer he worked, the clearer I could hear, and I was relieved. At the end he had to pull quite hard on my eardrum and this ached, and stung a bit as he worked.\n\nIt ended with a pop as he pulled it out of my ear.\n\n\"Hey Naoko, come take a look at this bad boy\"  he said excitedly.\n\nHe held in his hand a two inch long creature straight out of artwork from H.R. Giger.  A spiked eldritch horror that was ostensibly a bundle of earwax, from my right ear.\n\nI'm not saying that Shuko impregnated my ear with her demon spawn, but I somewhat suspect that Shuko impregnated my ear with her demon spawn.\n\nLater I would run a popular international exchange event that Shuko would turn up to. We eventually had to ban her because she was so sexually forward with absolutely everyone she met. I wished with all my heart for this to be the end of the Shuko story.\n\n---\nMercifully, the couple asked me to ask for their bill.\n\n\"You know, you're very good at this, you could be paid for this\" the husband said.\n\n\"Actually, I'm a paid tour guide for this area and Sendai at night in general\" I said.\n\n\"Oh, how is tour guiding as a job going for you?\" he asked, a bit condescending.\n\n\"Fine, when I'm paid for it!\" I said, not wanting to explain that it wasn't my full time job.\n\nThey left, finally. I enjoyed a few more sticks.\n\nThey were quickly replaced by a young hostess who appeared to taking a host out on an accompanied date. The hostess had long bright nails, a gucci bag, short skirt and boots. She met my eyes and we recognised each other immediately, but I decided it best not to acknowledge her unless she spoke to me first, I didn't know what was going on with her and the host.\n\nThe host had a bright red down jacket with fur lining, sunglasses, rings on all fingers and a lot of chains. They looked out of place in the smoky, dark-wood showa-era energy of Tori Yoshi. They came in and sat down. At least they would leave me alone and order for themselves I thought. He couldn't have been older than twenty five.\n\nThe mama took their drink order, and started writing it down. The host then started ordering his yakitori, which the mama didn't acknowledge.\n\n\"Looks like you're ignoring me\" he growled at the mama angrily.\n\nI felt a shot of bitter anger through my back.\n\n\"She's hard of hearing\" I said clearly, shooting daggers at him.\n\n\"Thanks for your input\" he said, looking back at me.\n\nNow I was just pissed. But thankfully I was done eating, so I settled my bill and got my tax receipt.\n\n\"Enjoy your time in Sendai boys\" I said to the fluid dynamics kids, then made for the door.\n\nThat's when Shuko appeared in the doorway. She'd lost a bit of weight but I knew it was her, the licker of ears. I assertively walked past her. Enough drama for one day.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1769914540296}}

This is not on focus for weight loss, so I think that in order to maintain my focus I need to stop drinking. My weight has ballooned up to 83.8kg, which I'm not happy about. Probably not a lot of that is fat, but still, it's not a good sign. This will be the third or fourth week in a row without weight loss.\n\nFrom today I'd like to regain and re-affirm that focus. Going out to drink/eat with [[渡邉麻里子|Mariko]]seems to be a trigger of sorts, so it's worth being careful there.\n\nThis week I have a lot of other things on my plate but I'm feeling good. I'm refraining from some of my normal dopamine producin()g activities so I can feel my creativity, productivity, and ability to work come back in the short term at least (the effect usually only lasts a couple of days, but it's a good couple of days).\n\n## Weight Loss\n\nToday we're attempting a fast and trying to keep calories at about 600.\n\nThis means:\n- [x] Being hungry until 18:00\n- [x] Cooking and eating at 18:00 according to the meal plan (brocolli, chicken, eggs)\n- [ ] Keeping the kitchen clean\n\n## Givery\n* [x] They've been waiting for my timesheets for last month.\n* [x] Timesheet approvals for the team.\n* [x] They've been waiting on CV review for a while\n\nBig things:\n- India strategy for Track TEST\n- General lack of productivity on the team\n- Working directly on the work (working with products and programming directly)\n\t- Think like a junior developer, for each product try to find an old backlog item that I can pick up and work on.\n\t- Get into the weeds of difficult projects.\n\n\n\n### Plan for today\n\n - 11:00 - APT Standup\n - 11:30 - Lewis 1:1\n - 13:30 - QA Team Sync\n - 16:00 Teitei 1:1\n - 17:00 - AI Interview Product 確認 meeting\n - 18:15 - Casual Chat \n\n#### AI Interview Standup\n- Kamiyama\n- Kobayashi -> Who are these people?\n- Uehara san\n- Hirota-san -> What is this guy? Seems to be new developer/system etc for the team, discussing requirements and so on.\n\n#### Ad-hoc meeting with Teitei\nFrontend Challenge\n- 7月29日 release date.\n- Frontend Challenge - Teitei wants to push this forward, ATS progress is a bit slow too, so maybe frontend challenge should be released as quickly as possible.\n\n#### APT Standup\n\n#### Ali's Scala Syllabus\n\n- Work through [[The Scala Book]]\n- Following coding exercises:\n\t- Use the play framework to make a REST API\n\t\t- Recipe management system\n\t\t- Connect to it over an API with postings or postman\n\t- Matasano Crypto Challenges set 1\n\t- \n\n\n\n\n\n## After Weight Loss\n\nToday feels like a relatively good day for weight loss so far. No alcohol, I've stuck to the plan, I'm at around 600kcal total which means perhaps a 1500kcal deficit. It's not a huge amount but I'm not gaining weight.  3 days a week like this is about 0.5kg, and if I add in the walks again I think that will get us to even higher deficits. We're trying to hit 1kg a week which is roughly 1000kcal per day.\n\nI suspect that today I'm just using up my glycogen stores, so the hunger didn't hit _too_ hard, maybe tomorrow will be more difficult. But altogether it doesn't feel too bad today. I am getting used to making friends with hunger and being OK sitting in that tension for a bit, and I don't hate it. It's not like things were on Rybelsus, which is good and bad. On the one hand I need to have that awareness of my hunger, but on the other I don't feel full all the time and genuinely enjoy food now, so I think on balance things are better than they are worse.\n\nAfter wight loss the focus will be on nampa, and after that on SNS. I think that in terms of business, I want to do one or more of:\n\n- Build my personal brand that will help amplify anything I do\n- Get good at building and flipping SaaS businesses\n- Build an English Language (pronunciation) teaching school and community with:\n\t- regular international exchange events\n\t- a bar/pub/restaurant for community members and gp to hang out at\n\t- A dedicated youtube channel and interview show\n- Build a much more profitable and comprehensive tour guiding business, the LTV/CAC etc all have to make sense for this business to work.\n\nLet's just stay focused on losing weight. All of this stuff can wait. "}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1769914540300}}

No results for `桜井`, `Sakurai Akiya`, `Yuriage`, or `閖上`.\n\n---\n\n### 1. `Another day in my strange life in Japan.md`\n**Context:** A long-form creative/diary piece about a single day in Ali's life in Sendai.\n\n**Sakurai / Yabe Sakaba mentions:**\n- Ali refers to the owner of **Yabe Sakaba** (a bar in the Iroha Yokocho side alleys) as **\"Sakurai daddy\"** — a warm, familial nickname.\n- Ali told Mariko: *\"I haven't seen Sakurai daddy in a while, so I want to drop by today.\"* Mariko encouraged him to go.\n- At Yabe Sakaba, \"daddy\" poured Ali a soda and lemon. They chatted casually — Sakurai asked about Ali's work, told funny stories about a tour guide, and Ali asked after \"mummy\" (Sakurai's wife).\n- Sakurai invited Ali to a **Christmas party on Dec 24th** — he'd bought a ready-made turkey and was confused about how to serve it. He also asked if Ali might spend the 24th with his boys (Ryu and Kei).\n- Sakurai showed Ali **very old faded black-and-white photos** of himself and friends as children at the beach. Ali photographed them and sent them to Mariko.\n- When Ali tried to pay, Sakurai **told him to fuck off** (affectionately refused payment). Ali laughed and left.\n\n**Character portrait:** Sakurai is clearly a fatherly figure to Ali — warm, generous (free drinks, refuses payment), interested in Ali's life, and socially connected (inviting Ali to family gatherings). The \"daddy/mummy\" naming convention signals a quasi-adopted family relationship. The bar itself (Yabe Sakaba) is a small, intimate spot with a noren curtain and sliding door, in the side alleys of what appears to be Iroha Yokocho in Sendai.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `2025-07-07.md`\n**Context:** Daily note focused on weight loss and work planning.\n\n**Yabe Sakaba mention:**\n- *\"Yesterday 2025-07-06, I went to Yabe sakaba and drank a lot for free, ended up getting quite drunk.\"*\n- Ali identifies this as counter to his weight loss focus. He resolves to stop drinking, noting his weight has ballooned to 83.8kg.\n- Going out to drink/eat with Mariko is identified as a trigger.\n\n**Note:** Again, free drinks at Yabe Sakaba — consistent with Sakurai's refusal to let Ali pay.\n\n---\n\n### 3. `2025 in Review.md`\n**Context:** Ali's summary of 2025 highlights.\n\n**Sakurai mention:**\n- Listed as **[[Sakurai-san]]** among attendees at Ali's **birthday party on August 9th at Rob Roy**.\n- Other attendees: Bisha Ali, Yamanami Airi, Haru, Fujiwara no Masanori, Mariko, and others.\n\n**Note:** The wiki-link `[[Sakurai-san]]` suggests Ali intended a dedicated note, but no such file exists in the vault yet.\n\n---\n\n## No Results For\n- **桜井** (kanji) — not used in any vault notes\n- **Sakurai Akiya** — not mentioned\n- **Yuriage / 閖上** — no mentions found anywhere in the vault\n\n---\n\n## Summary Profile: Sakurai-san\n\n| Detail | Value |\n|---|---|\n| **Nickname** | Sakurai daddy |\n| **Establishment** | Yabe Sakaba (side alleys, likely Iroha Yokocho, Sendai) |\n| **Wife** | Referred to as \"mummy\" (name unknown) |\n| **Relationship to Ali** | Quasi-paternal; close personal bond |\n| **Key traits** | Generous (free drinks, refuses payment), warm, social, curious about Ali's life |\n| **Notable events** | Christmas party invitation (Dec 24); birthday party attendee (Aug 9, Rob Roy); showed old childhood beach photos |\n| **Vault note** | `[[Sakurai-san]]` linked but does not exist yet |\n"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-opus-4-5","usage":{"input":1,"output":1227,"cacheRead":17381,"cacheWrite":132,"totalTokens":18741,"cost":{"input":0.000005,"output":0.030675,"cacheRead":0.0086905,"cacheWrite":0.000825,"total":0.0401955}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1769914544732}}
