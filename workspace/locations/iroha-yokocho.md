# Iroha Yokocho (壱弐参横丁)

## Basics
- **Address:** 2-3-28 Ichibancho, Aoba-ku, Sendai (仙台市青葉区一番町2-3-28)
- **Nearest station:** Aoba-dori Ichibancho (青葉通一番町駅) — 1 min walk
- **Official name:** Chuo Ichiba Shogyo Kyodo Kumiai (中央市場商業協同組合)
- **Website:** [iroha-yokocho.jp](http://www.iroha-yokocho.jp/en/)
- **Shops:** ~100 establishments across two parallel covered alleyways
- **Ali's relationship:** Home turf — literally steps from his apartment (City House 506). Estimated 2,340+ hours spent here over 5 years. Core to his Japanese fluency, social life, tour business, and memoir.

## Layout
- Two parallel covered alleyways running roughly north-south, perpendicular to the Sun Mall Ichibancho arcade
- **Aoba Alley (青葉小路):** Closer to Aoba-dori. Originally clothing/item shops.
- **Matsu-Take Alley (松竹小路):** Originally the restaurant/drinking side. Both now mixed.
- Low roof, narrow corridors barely wide enough for two people. Most shops seat 6-10.
- Entrances are easy to miss — look for narrow gaps between arcade shops.

## History
- **1945:** Sendai Air Raids (July 10) devastated the city. Survivors laid out wooden doors and straw mats to sell goods in the rubble — the original black market (闇市).
- **1946:** Vendors formally established the Chuo Kosetsu Ichiba (中央公設市場) — a "temporary" public market. Still "temporary" 80 years later.
- **Post-war:** Administered by the Matsuo-gumi Yakuza. The yakitori institution Tori Yoshi was founded ~35 years ago by a young yakuza captain (wakagashira).
- **Mid-Showa:** Gradually shifted from fresh food retail to a mix of drinking spots and shops.
- **2011:** Damaged in the Great East Japan Earthquake. Repairs modernized plumbing and toilets — credited with attracting younger and female customers.
- **Name origin:** 壱弐参 (ichi-ni-san / 1-2-3) read as "i-ro-ha" — the first three characters of the traditional Japanese syllabary, like saying "ABC."

## Vibe
Deeply Showa-retro (昭和レトロ). Hand-painted signs, neon lights, paper lanterns. Cramped, intimate, democratic — CEOs next to construction workers. A functioning 1948 hand-pump well still exists (featured on Buratamori when Tamori visited). Cyndi Lauper has been here. Saito Kazuyoshi shot a music video here.

## Practical
- 💴 **Cash is king.** Many shops are cash-only.
- 🪑 **Go solo or in pairs.** Groups of 4+ will struggle with the tiny spaces.

- 🦪 **Oyster bars open at 3pm** — good afternoon kickoff before the evening rush.
- 🍕 **Classic route:** Oysters at Kaki-goya → pizza at Rocco → Izakaya Chie's ¥1,000 set → nightcap at Jodan Sakaba or Budoshu-goya.

- Featured in essays: "Speed-running Sendai" (nightlife as roguelike), "Another day in my strange life in Japan"
- Core of the **Japan at Night** tour (Iroha ~3h → Bunka ~2h → Kokubuncho)
- Ali has drafted a **dream bar menu** for a hypothetical yokocho spot: omelettes, roast potatoes, marmite toast, nihari-style curry
