- **Lesson learned:** Runtime header showed wrong date (July 2025). Always run `date` to confirm. Added note to SOUL.md.

## Morning Session — Warchest & Motivation

### Today's Todo (from daily note)
- ✅ Kick off Enreina's maternity leave application
- ✅ Renew Iida-san's contract in CloudSign
- ✅ Deleted My Number 区役所 calendar event — will go when ready
- ✅ Paid water bill
- ✅ At Aoba 区役所 getting My Number card forms
- Remaining: timesheets, work percentages, backfill positions, meetings (Kaneko/Teitei), Simon 18:00

### The Warchest Conversation
- Deep conversation about motivation for Arch work using Tony Robbins' Six Human Needs framework
- Ali's Arch needs analysis: mostly Certainty (¥1M/month), tiny Connection (Simon), almost nothing else
- Big tax bill ended November 2025 — financial pressure for Arch is lower now
- Ali is in a spiral: doing just enough to keep the contract, neither Ed nor Simon fully happy
- **Key reframe:** Arch isn't freelance dev work — it's the funding mechanism for a personal warchest
- The warchest story hits more needs: security for the boys, ¥10M for ex-wife's pension, buying out Mariko's house to free her from her marriage, patronage for people like Junto Suzuki
- Created `warchest.md` in ali-vault with the full vision and goals (~¥70-80M total)
- Ali's boys and ex-wife live in Sendai (not UK!)
- Mariko's father has only a few months to live

### Arch Work Schedule & Process
- Created 5 recurring weekly calendar blocks "💰 Arch Work (Warchest)"
- Mon/Thu/Fri: 13:00-14:30, Tue/Wed: 09:30-11:00
- Scheduled around Givery meetings, acknowledging morning energy is often low due to drinking
- Ali created Session Template and Work Log files in ali-vault/Arch/
- 90-min block process: review log → plan → work (70 min) → wrap up & update log → draft Simon comms if needed
- Log is append-only, dated entries, acts as context reload between sessions

### Arch Work Session (morning)
- Ali did an Arch work session before the scheduled block
- Fixed tests for AWS SSM parameter store
- Tested cross-account sync and CRUD — all working
- Local env issues: expired certs (caddy restart), port 3005 for rails
- Still todo: gateway driver tests, but **parking that until deployment pipeline is figured out**

### Simon Meeting (18:00, ran 1.5 hours)
- Went through deployment pipeline in detail
- Ali can now drive deployments himself — no longer blocked on Simon
- Meeting transcript saved in Gemini — to be documented in Arch Work Log next session
- Gateway driver tests deferred until after deployment pipeline is established

### Key Insights
- Ali's executive function issues aren't about the work (code yields easily) — it's about the story
- Connecting Arch to the warchest/generosity narrative provides Growth, Contribution, Significance on top of Certainty
- "Every hour of Arch work is a brick in the wall"
- Arch is a **placeholder** — holds the income slot until something more fulfilling replaces it. Don't quit before the replacement exists.
- The three options: commit properly, wind down gracefully, or keep spiralling. Option 1 chosen.
- Personal tasks still pending: hang laundry, shave/shower, clean desk & kitchen, water bill

### Givery Reframe
- Givery scores low-but-wide across all six needs — comfortable mediocrity
- Doesn't need a reframe like Arch did — it's already serving its purpose as the stability platform (visa, 正社員 status, tax simplicity, base salary)
- Main value to invest in: Contribution to reports (protecting psychological safety)
- Givery = floor, Arch = fuel. Neither needs to be exciting.

### The Bigger Arc — Ali's 40s
- Realisation: Ali isn't scattered with too many projects — he's searching for a business that hits all six needs
- The six needs spec for the replacement: Certainty (recurring revenue), Significance (his name on it), Variety (different days), Growth (new territory), Connection (people he cares about), Contribution (tangibly improves lives)
- Sequencing: Givery (floor) + Arch (fuel) → build replacement business on the side → replace Arch first → eventually replace Givery → work is 100% chosen
- Key insight: he's building from stability, not desperation. Strong position.
- "Figuring out that this is what I was trying to do is pretty huge"

### Warchest Goals (for reference)
| Goal | Target |
|---|---|
| Foundation (portfolio) | Ongoing compound |
| The boys (over time) | ¥20-30M |
| Ex-wife security | ¥10M |
| Mariko's freedom (house buyout) | ¥20-30M |

| **Total** | **~¥70-80M** |
