## Disco Elysium Discussion

Ali started playing Disco Elysium. Intrigued by the Thought Cabinet mechanic — the idea that thinking itself is a mechanical process with costs and rewards, and that you actively construct identity through what you choose to dwell on.

Discussed what makes the game special:
- Skills as literal voices arguing in your head (Electrochemistry, Inland Empire, Volition, etc.)
- Politics treated seriously without being preachy
- The writing is literary-good — Dostoevsky-at-3am energy
- Lets you be a disaster, not just hero or villain

Ali asked for no spoilers — going in blind.

## Sleep Cycle Repair

Ali was trying to stay awake to fix his sleep cycle. Flagging energy. Target: make it to 7pm. Asked for moral support rather than strategies.
