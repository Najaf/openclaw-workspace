# 2026-02-14 — Friday (Valentine's Day)

## Session Logs & Memory Infrastructure

- Discovered session logs live at `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/` (not `.clawdbot`)
- Backfilled memory files for Feb 10-13 by scanning session logs
- Created **Daily Memory Consolidation** cron job (23:59 JST) to automate this nightly
- Discussed hooks system — `boot-md`, `session-memory`, `command-logger` available; `session:start` hook is planned but not yet implemented

## Alcohol & Mental Clarity

Ali reflected on the contrast between days with and without alcohol:
- One clear day showed dramatically crisp, clear thinking even without adequate sleep
- Currently feeling "chaotic, gummy, floppy" after drinking
- **Proposed experiment:** Sun-Thu no drinking, Fri-Sat allowed
- Reframe: not "avoiding alcohol" but "wanting the crisp state"
- Two tours next week — no need to drink on them
- Noted as an experiment, not a commitment — honest about uncertainty

## Givery Japanese Language Presentation

Reviewed Ali's Obsidian notes for his Japanese conversation presentation:
- Core thesis: 5000+ hours of conversation is how you learn, not apps/textbooks
- Local maximums concept: skill acquisition requires temporary regression
- Three channels: Information → Emotional → Social/Cultural (each enables the next)
- Main Q&A concern from audience: confidence to stick to Japanese, not be embarrassed
- Ali's answer: "I'm completely fucking shameless, try it!"

## Mariko Relationship Deep Dive

Ali shared the 2019 LINE conversation with Mark — a confrontation about Mark offering Mariko a job despite their sexual history:

**The Mark Conflict:**
- Mark slept with Mariko while she worked for him, then tried to hire her again
- Ali called out Mark's rationalizations, held firm: "you fucked someone that was working for you and now you want to shift responsibility onto me and Mariko"
- Ali pointed out Mark's "ironclad rules" didn't match his track record
- Ended with "you're either an asshole or completely fucking thoughtless, and either way I don't want much to do with you after this"

**What Ali carried:**
- Mariko went to dinner with Mark without telling Ali — he was ready to break up over it
- Didn't break up because she was about to terminate a pregnancy (his) — couldn't stomach leaving her during that
- They worked through it eventually

**Current state:**
- Still jealous over Mariko, probably always will be
- She doesn't respond reassuringly to his jealousy (e.g., warmly greeting Mark on the street)
- Relationship has good emotional affinity — they know each other's quirks and cycles
- Not defensive with each other, don't criticize, have genuine affection
- Sexual frequency: ~weekly, really good ~monthly; she's not super enthusiastic but doesn't withhold
- Ali knows "containment" (pulling back) builds desire, should do it more

**Ali's moral framework on relationships:**
- Sleeps with attached women but doesn't deliberately target them
- Never touches acquaintances' partners — that's the line
- Has asymmetric boundaries with Mariko: he can stray, she can't (she accepted this with eyes open after Kana)

**What makes the relationship worth it:**
- Comfortable sex
- "Good witness to my life" — she holds the thread, knows the full picture
- She has her own goals and pursues them
- They listen to each other, don't dislike each other's company
- Not measuring success by duration — quality over length
