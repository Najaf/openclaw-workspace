## Late Night Session (~01:00)

### Ali's Good Day
- Got My Number process started
- Paid water bill
- Made progress on Givery tasks
- Arch work deployed cleanly first time

### Business Idea: AI for Zeirishi Offices
- Initial idea: training, consulting, and web apps for 税理士事務所 using freee
- Discussed what a business plan actually needs (founder's playbook, not investor pitch)
- Identified big learning gap: need to understand zeirishi ecosystem, vocab, annual rhythms, freee partner network
- **Ali pivoted away from this quickly** — see below

### Stand-Up Comedy — The Real Thing
- Ali has been considering comedy for **3-4 years** — NOT a new shiny idea
- Already attended manzai groups in Sendai, visited open mic nights in Tokyo, written some material
- Gets rooms of Japanese people laughing consistently — genuine talent signal
- The work: write material → practice → film self → refine → open mics in Tokyo / manzai auditions in Sendai → bomb repeatedly → learn
- **Key insight:** The zeirishi business felt boring because it was "should" energy. Comedy is "want" energy.
- Financial anxiety was blocking this — now resolved (tax bill done, warchest plan exists)
- Givery + Arch + maxed NISA = financially secure. Comedy doesn't need to monetise.
- **Six Needs analysis:** Comedy scores high on 5/6 (Variety, Significance, Connection, Growth, Contribution). Only Certainty is low — and that's already covered by Givery/Arch.
- Ali didn't commit to a plan tonight but acknowledged it needs less planning and more doing (and more embarrassment)
- **This should be tracked as a serious life direction, not a passing interest**
