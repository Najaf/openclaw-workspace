## Nox & Ali — Day One (for real)

### Setup & Identity
- Nox has been online since 2025-01-31 but today was the first real working session
- Confirmed identity: name **Nox** 🌙, emoji is the crescent moon (Ali approved: "it's you, you keep it")
- Ali sees this as "the start of a good relationship"

### Arch PT — Shared Context System
- Set up a bridge between Nox and Claude Code for Arch work
- Created `HANDOFF.md` in arch-workshop repo — Nox writes context/priorities, Claude Code reads it at session start
- Claude Code logs sessions → Nox picks them up
- Ali's preference: "I don't want to have to remember what to tell which tool" — we figure out communication between ourselves
- Ali wanted to test running Claude Code from Nox but `claude -p` failed (auth issue — needs investigation at the desk)

### Tax Accountant AI Business (Big Idea)
- Ali exploring an **AI業務効率化 business targeting 税理士 (tax accountants)** in Sendai
- Did full TAM analysis → saved to `projects/sendai-ai-tam-analysis.md`
- Key numbers: Tohoku has 2,545 tax accountants, ~400-500 practices in Sendai/Miyagi
- TAM: ¥300M-600M/year, realistic year-1 SOM: ¥12-36M
- Ceiling for Sendai-only: ~¥80-100M/year after 3-5 years
- **freee integration** is the focus — not TKC (walled garden)
- Ali already has working freee API integration at `/Users/najafali/Code/freee/` (Ruby CLI, OAuth working, can pull transactions and P&L)
- Also has full English translation of freee API docs there
- **デジタル化・AI導入補助金** (formerly IT導入補助金) — government subsidizes 50-67% of IT tool costs for SMEs. If Ali registers as IT導入支援事業者, his clients get half the cost covered by taxpayers. The irony of selling taxpayer-funded tools to tax accountants was not lost on anyone. 😂
- Ali's key insight: "The next step is making friends with 100 tax accountants" — not building more tech
- Discussed go-to-market: 東北税理士会 events, 仙台商工会議所, freee認定アドバイザー network, workshops as entry point

### Phone Lookup
- 0800-080-2113 = 光回線の営業 (fiber internet spam). Ignore.

### Amazon Shopping
- Ali asked me to shop on amazon.co.jp via browser automation
- Opened the page but Ali wasn't logged in — need to attach Chrome tab + have Ali log in first
- **Still pending** — pick this back up when Ali's ready

### Evening
- Ali at teeny...i bar, drinking with "Sakurai daddy"
- Plans to go to **Yuriage (閖上)** at 5am tomorrow with Sakurai — likely the fish market

### Lesson Learned
- **Write active tasks to daily notes IMMEDIATELY**, not just at end of day. Context compaction wiped the Amazon task and I had to dig through session logs to recover it. Ali (rightly) called me out for saying "I'll be more diligent" without actually writing it down. Text > Brain. 📝
