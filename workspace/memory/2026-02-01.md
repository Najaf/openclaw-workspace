## Kanno Mamiko people file update
- Ali asked me to search Gmail for all correspondence with Kanno Mamiko and update her people file
- Found emails from kannomamiko@gmail.com (2018-2019): tax accountant intros, BJJ gear purchases, travel bookings (Fukuoka trip), Christmas toy shopping
- Also found Ryu's emails (kannoryunosuke49@gmail.com, 2022-2023): asking for UMA books, D&D stuff, Frieren manga
- Added contact details (email, phone 080-9637-5224, Kaigamori address), email correspondence section, expanded timeline

## Watanabe Mariko people file created
- Spawned sub-agent to search vault + Gmail for Watanabe Mariko info
- Sub-agent found ~30+ vault references, created people file at people/watanabe-mariko.md
- Ali corrected: relationship started in 2019 (not 2023 as vault entries suggested), and Ali introduced her to Mogi (not the other way around)
- Fixed and committed

## Spotify
- spotify_player CLI auth is broken (403 Forbidden) — needs re-auth
- Opened Spotify via AppleScript instead (`osascript -e 'tell application "Spotify" to activate'`)

## Notes
- Ali is at the laptop today (can take app focus)
- Memory search is disabled (no OpenAI/Google API key configured for embeddings)
