## Memoir Framing — Disco Elysium Connection

Ali drew a parallel between Disco Elysium and his memoir idea: *"an unlikeable and broadly weak protagonist running up against the electrochemical chaos of life without morals or restraint"*

Key insight: Harry Du Bois works because the game commits to the mess — the pathetic fumbling, grandiose delusions, and genuine flashes of insight buried under cope. The internal voices (Electrochemistry, Volition, Inland Empire) literalize the competing drives.

**Third person consideration:** Ali floated writing the memoir in third person. Benefits:
- Observational distance — can be cruel to the protagonist without sounding self-flagellating
- Narrator relationship becomes its own texture
- Mailer did this in *The Armies of the Night* — referred to himself as "Mailer" throughout

Open question: What would he call himself? "Ali" feels too close. Needs a layer of remove.

## Breathwork Deep Dive

Long conversation about breathing and the nervous system.

**The basics:**
- Vagus nerve is the parasympathetic highway
- Inhale → heart rate up (sympathetic nudge)
- Exhale → heart rate down (parasympathetic via vagal tone)
- Extending exhale tilts the ratio toward calm

**Post-exhale pause:**
- Extends parasympathetic window
- CO2 rises slightly → mild vasodilation, feels calming
- Interrupts automatic breath cycle — "off autopilot"
- Trains discomfort tolerance (air hunger)

**Ali's experience:** Found that slow exhales with post-exhale pauses (to slight discomfort) completely calm his racing mind when trying to sleep. Thoughts stop arising. This was a significant finding for him.

**Opposite protocol (sympathetic activation):**
- Longer inhales + hold after inhale
- Creates controlled stress response
- Can surface emotions (anger, sadness)
- Followed by rebound calm after stopping

**Pre-presentation protocol:**
- 15 sympathetic breaths → raises alertness
- 6 parasympathetic breaths → drops activation without losing alertness
- Net result: alert but not anxious

**Urge management:**
- Discussed breathing patterns for strong urges
- Slow exhales + holds can interrupt the urge-action loop
