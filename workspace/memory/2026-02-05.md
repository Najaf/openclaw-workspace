## Morning
- Arch Dev Team call — Jon and Olly joined late (team was with client)
- Created calendar event for 09:30-11:00: Open New Positions (Enreina backfill + AI Interview)
- Set up Wise Support email check cron (every 15 min, auto-removes at 23:00)
- Had to fix gog gmail syntax in cron job twice (it kept using `list` instead of `search`)
- Also fixed duplicate alerting — cron kept re-reporting same debit card email

## Wise Payment Issue
- Wise has a payment under review, Ali waiting on support response
- Last real support email: Feb 4 15:00 "Your question" — they said 1 working day
- No reply as of 17:30
- Ali's cash is locked up because of this — significant stress
- Mariko offered to lend ¥40k until payday, Ali accepted reluctantly
- This bothers him — he wants to be helping her financially, not the reverse

## Writing / Anonymous Publishing
- Ali wants to publish memoir-style essays under a pen name
- "Japan crazy story memoir things"
- Already has material in Obsidian vault (ia-writer-import folder)
- Good pieces: "When I was 15" (memoir, literary), hostess guide (practical/authority)
- Recommended Substack under pen name + protonmail
- Discussion paused — to be continued

## Meetings
- Alex 1-on-1 (12:00)
- Arch Work block (13:00-14:30)
- EM Problem Solving (15:00-15:45)
- Simon catch-up (18:00)

## Simon Call (18:00)
- Ed told Ali this morning he hadn't heard from Simon and was concerned about dev speed over past years
- Ali relayed this to Simon as a heads-up so he wouldn't be blindsided
- Simon's dad recently died of a stroke — dealing with estate in UK + grief
- Ed appears insensitive to Simon's situation
- Ali had previously offered Ed to take a few weeks off so Simon could process without extra pressure — Ed ignored this, never told Simon
- Simon cried, thanked Ali for the offer
- Ali: doesn't have anything against Ed, but this hasn't endeared Ed to him
- Simon's framing: "we're the help, we don't need to be Ed's friend"
- Dysfunctional but pragmatic — Arch is fuel, not a relationship. Money spends the same.

## Cash Float Plan
- Wise lockout caused real stress — Mariko lending ¥40k until payday (Ali reached out to her)
- Ali wants to build ¥1M cash float at home as "new zero" after tax season
- Operational resilience, not investment — so no single institution can strand him

## Mood
- "Not amazing but nothing bad happened" — only Monday felt like a good day
- Cash flow stress from Wise is the main weight
- Simon call was emotionally heavy but handled well

## Cron Cleanup Failed (23:00 JST)
- Tried to remove 'Wise Support Email Check' cron job (df444ebe-f415-4450-abc8-fc551d191a94) and the cleanup job itself (bd077d02-0367-440d-a297-59bf2138972a)
- Gateway kept timing out on all cron operations (list, remove) despite being running (pid 16149, RPC probe ok)
- These jobs still need to be removed — try again next session or heartbeat
