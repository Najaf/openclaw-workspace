## 1. Market Size: How Many Tax Accountants?

### National Numbers (as of Dec 2025, from 日本税理士会連合会)
- **82,276** registered individual tax accountants nationwide
- **5,252** tax corporations (税理士法人) with main offices
- **3,065** branch offices of tax corporations
- Organized into 15 regional associations

### Tohoku Region (東北税理士会)
- **2,545** registered tax accountants
- **184** tax corporations (main offices)
- **133** branch offices
- Covers: Miyagi, Aomori, Iwate, Akita, Yamagata, Fukushima (6 prefectures)

### Sendai/Miyagi Estimate
Miyagi is the economic center of Tohoku (~35-40% of regional GDP, with Sendai at ~1.1M population out of Tohoku's ~8.5M).

**Estimated Miyagi prefecture:**
- ~900-1,000 individual tax accountants
- ~70-80 tax corporations
- Total addressable offices/practices: **~500-600** (many individuals share practices or are employed by corporations)

**Estimated Sendai city specifically:**
- ~600-750 of those are concentrated in Sendai (as the major urban center)

### Key Insight: Count Practices, Not People
The buying unit isn't an individual tax accountant — it's the *practice/office*. A tax corporation with 5 tax accountants is one customer. Solo practitioners are one customer each. The real target count for Sendai/Miyagi is roughly **400-500 distinct practices**.

## 2. What Tax Accountants Actually Do (Pain Points)

Tax accountant work is heavily document-driven and seasonal:

**Core services they provide:**
- Tax return preparation (確定申告, 法人税申告)
- Bookkeeping and financial statement preparation
- Tax consultation and advisory
- Tax audit representation (税務調査立会)
- Payroll and social insurance (many do this as add-on)
- Business succession / inheritance tax planning (相続・事業承継)

**Peak seasons:**
- Jan-Mar: Individual tax returns (確定申告 season — brutal)
- Corporate year-ends: Staggered but Mar/Sep heavy
- Year-end adjustments (年末調整): Nov-Jan

**Biggest pain points for AI to address:**
1. **Document processing** — Reading client receipts, invoices, bank statements → journal entries
2. **Tax return drafting** — First-pass preparation from financial data
3. **Client communication** — Repetitive Q&A, document requests, status updates
4. **Research** — Tax law lookups, ruling interpretation, precedent search
5. **Report writing** — Advisory memos, succession plans, audit prep documents
6. **Meeting notes** — Summarizing client consultations

## 3. Competitive Landscape

### Incumbent Software Vendors (already selling to tax accountants)
- **TKC** — Dominant player. 10,000+ member tax accountants nationwide. Provides integrated accounting/tax software, e-filing, bank monitoring. Has its own AI features in development. *This is the 800lb gorilla.*
- **弥生 (Yayoi)** — Popular accounting software, widely used by smaller practices
- **freee** — Cloud accounting, growing in the tax accountant advisory market
- **Money Forward** — Cloud accounting, similar trajectory to freee
- **JDL** — Traditional tax software vendor, strong in tax offices
- **達人シリーズ (NTT Data)** — Tax return software, very widely used

### AI-Specific Competitors
- **ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini** — Individual tax accountants already experimenting with general-purpose AI
- **TKC's AI initiatives** — They'll inevitably build AI into their platform
- **freee's AI features** — Already doing auto-categorization, moving toward AI advisory
- **Legal/tax AI startups** — LegalForce, AI-CON (contract review, adjacent)
- **Generic DX consultancies** — Offering AI workshops but not tax-accountant specific

### Gap in the Market
Nobody is offering **tax-accountant-specific AI workflow consulting + implementation** at the local level. The big vendors are building AI into their platforms (top-down), but individual practices need help:
- Figuring out *which* AI tools to use
- Building practice-specific prompts and workflows
- Training staff (not just the lead tax accountant)
- Integration with existing TKC/Yayoi/JDL workflows

## 4. Pricing & Willingness to Pay

### What tax accountants currently spend on software
- TKC membership + software: ~¥30,000-¥100,000/month depending on scale
- Additional software (Yayoi, 達人, etc.): ¥10,000-¥50,000/month
- Total IT spend for a typical practice: ¥50,000-¥200,000/month

### What they might pay for AI efficiency services

**Workshop/Training model (one-time):**
- ¥50,000-¥150,000 per workshop (half-day to full-day)
- Group workshops through tax accountant association: ¥10,000-¥30,000/person

**Consulting/Implementation model (project-based):**
- ¥300,000-¥1,000,000 per engagement (assess workflows, build AI processes, train staff)
- 2-4 week engagement

**Ongoing subscription/advisory:**
- ¥30,000-¥100,000/month for ongoing AI support + prompt library + updates
- Higher for firms: ¥100,000-¥300,000/month

### Subsidy Angle
- **IT導入補助金** — Covers up to 50-80% of IT tool costs. If your service qualifies as an approved IT vendor, this dramatically lowers the barrier.
- **ものづくり補助金** — Potentially applicable for larger firms investing in process innovation
- Getting approved as an IT導入補助金 vendor would be a major accelerator.

## 5. TAM / SAM / SOM Calculation

### TAM (Total Addressable Market) — Sendai/Miyagi

**Conservative (workshop + light consulting only):**
- 500 practices × ¥50,000 average annual spend = **¥25M/year**

**Mid-range (consulting + subscription model):**
- 500 practices × ¥150,000/month × 12 = not realistic for all
- More realistically: 500 practices × avg ¥50,000/month × 12 = **¥300M/year**

**Aggressive (deep implementation + ongoing advisory):**
- 500 practices × avg ¥150,000/month × 12 = **¥900M/year**

**Working TAM estimate: ¥300M-¥600M/year for Sendai/Miyagi**

### SAM (Serviceable Available Market)
Not every practice will adopt AI services. Factors:
- Age demographics: Tax accountants skew older (average age ~60+). Younger practitioners more likely to adopt.
- Tech readiness: Maybe 30-40% are open to AI tools in the near term
- SAM = **¥100M-¥200M/year** (TAM × 30%)

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) — Year 1
As a new entrant with Ali's profile (workshop experience, local network, technical credibility):
- Realistic year-1 target: **20-30 practices**
- Mix of workshops and consulting engagements
- Average revenue per client: ¥50,000-¥100,000/month (or equivalent project fees)
- **SOM = ¥12M-¥36M/year**

---

## 6. Go-to-Market Considerations

### Advantages
- Ali already runs an LLM workshop (「社会人のための生成AIを味方にする90分」) — proven format
- Tax accountant associations (税理士会) are organized and hold regular study sessions → built-in distribution
- Sendai is small enough to build personal relationships with key firms
- 確定申告 season creates urgent, predictable pain → great timing for a pitch

### Challenges
- Tax accountants are conservative and trust-driven (relationship-heavy sales cycle)
- TKC's dominance means many are locked into an ecosystem
- Regulatory sensitivity — tax work has legal liability, so "AI doing tax work" makes people nervous
- Older demographic may be resistant

### Recommended Entry Strategy
1. **Partner with the local 税理士会** — Offer to do a study session / workshop on AI for tax practices (low barrier, high credibility)
2. **Lead with training, follow with implementation** — Workshop → "want help actually setting this up?" → consulting engagement → monthly advisory
3. **Focus on non-regulated tasks first** — Document processing, client comms, internal knowledge management (not "AI prepares your tax returns")
4. **IT導入補助金 certification** — Get approved as a vendor to remove budget objections
5. **Target younger partners/successors** — Many firms have succession dynamics where the next-gen leader wants to modernize
