**paulrsd** (Mar 2025) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"This is among our favorite food and bar crawls in Japan, Italy and Greece. Ali knows his way around and each stop has quality authenticity and personality. Do not miss this is Sendai. Enough said!"
> Host reply: "You were both an absolute delight to go out on the town with, I couldn't ask for better guests! I particularly enjoyed Dream On and Hotel California that we sang with the gaggle of salarymen that gatecrashed our last venue."

**Calder_L** (Mar 2025) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "The only way to experience Sendai at night"
"Ali showed all the hidden experiences that only a local would really know. I couldn't have had a better experience than the one Ali provided without living and breathing Sendai for at least 10 years."

**mariannecreverett** (Feb 2025) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Best evening out!"
"We had the best night out in Japan so far! Ali was really helpful in finding places that were tailored to us specifically, including managing dietary requirements and we loved all the different bars he took us too."
> Host reply mentioned guests singing Yoasobi's アイドル

**Humera_S** (Jan 2025) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Unique and fun tour! Ali is VERY easy to talk to and is friends with all the shop owners :)"
"I was nervous to book this tour because of the few reviews, but I'm glad I did. I had a fantastic tour with Ali! He is incredibly kind and charismatic. He took us around to different restaurants/bars and tailored the evening to our interests. It was just my husband, myself and Ali, because Ali is easy to talk to and clearly has a knack as a host, it wasn't awkward! We had a great time drinking cocktails and eating delicious food. Ali took us to places that seemed to be locals only. The owners at all the spots were excited to see him and would enthusiastically greet us. Ali was an excellent host and this tour was well worth the cost. I can't imagine a better way of exploring the Sendai food scene!"

**Samuel_R** (Dec 2024) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Best night out imaginable"
"This was an absolutely amazing and fantastic experience. I had a blast all night. The tour was fully customised to the experience I was after and what I liked. Ali, truly knows all the best spots in Sendai, it was an experience I would not easily forget. The variety of places I was taken to was amazing, I had such a unique and wonderful experience in each. I really do recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great time. It's a 10/10."

**Alex_W** (Dec 2024) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Please Book This Tour"
"I could not recommend this tour enough. One of my most memorable nights out ever. Ali was fantastic and very knowledgable of the area. He was flexible and was able to accommodate our interests as they arose throughout the evening. Everywhere we went was a unique and wonderful experience. He was super friendly and charismatic. It's easy to see that he really knows the locals well and that they know and like him too which was really nice. I would have never found these places without him. Also, Ali made sure we both got home safe at the end of the evening as well, which we really appreciated."

**Elbert_L** (Nov 2024) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Great night out in Sendai"
"Ali was a fantastic guide, very knowledgeable of the local food/drink scene and close connections with the owners. The places we went to were all amazing, and the energy was good through the night"

**Curtis_A** (Nov 2024) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Best of Sendai"
"Private tour through Sendai. I really like that Ali takes the time before the tour to arrange an itinerary that caters to your interests. We visited a few hole in the wall eating and drinking spots, each with its own specialty. Many of these places have limited seating usually reserved for locals, but Ali helps get you in to try these hidden gems that a tourist might otherwise struggle to visit themselves. Ali is very knowledgeable about the area and even gave me some recommendations for places to visit later in my trip. I've been on a few eating and drinking tours around Japan, but this was my favorite by far. Small private groups let's you enjoy Sendai with the locals instead of being put to just the tourist table."

**Andy_G** (Nov 2024) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — "Great guide!"
"Ali showed us a great time taking us to places we would have never gotten to on our own. Would recommend!"

### TripAdvisor Reviews (visible — 5 of 16)

**Dan L** (Apr 2025) — "We had a fantastic time with our tour guide Ali in Sendai, Japan. He took us to five different restaurants and bars, each offering unique local flavors and experiences we wouldn't have found on our own. Ali is incredibly knowledgeable about the area and its food scene, and his friendly, easygoing nature made the evening fun and relaxed. It was clear he has strong connections with the local community, which added an authentic touch to the tour."

**wanderwallah** (Apr 2025) — "Ali was very engaging and really knows his stuff - so much so that all the managers and staff at the Izakayas and bars we went to, know him well so we got personal service. He also adapted the tour to my preferences so the experience was more than I could have hoped for."

**Fredrik L** (Apr 2025) — "Friendly tour with good food and drinks. We got to see a lot great small places that we'd never find ourselves and all of them represented a different niche of the japanese culture!"

**LeanneK** (Mar 2025) — "Ali was exceptionally informative and professional throughout the booking, tour itself and follow up the next day when we returned to a bar with friends. He has a great rapport with the bar owners and understanding and respect of Japanese culture. No question was off limits and answered honestly which immensely helped our understanding of Japanese culture and customs. Great value for money."

**KC** (Feb 2025) — "Ali speaks fluent Japanese and asks if you have any requests after booking. I went to several small shops that day, all of which came from the locals, and Ali booked a seat in advance, no wait. Things are delicious, Japanese wine and cocktails are great, and the atmosphere in several shops is good, very local. Ali also explains cuisine and drinks. Very pleasant experience."
