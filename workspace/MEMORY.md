# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## Arch Platform Technologies (Freelance)
- Ali freelances as a Rails engineer for Arch PT, working on their **Mane** platform (VDI/cloud workstation orchestration on AWS)
- Key people: **Simon Lau** (main dev contact), **Ed Churchward** (business side, wants visible progress)
- Code lives at `/Users/najafali/Code/freelance/archpt/` — detailed context in `projects/arch.md`
- Tech: Rails 6.1, React 18, Hydra OAuth2, deep AWS integration
- Relationship has had ups and downs — attendance/visibility is important to Ed
- Current feature: SSM Parameter Management (tests fixed, cross-account working, deployment pipeline TBD)
- **Motivation reframe (2026-02):** Arch = warchest funding, not just freelance work. Connected to life goals via Tony Robbins' Six Human Needs framework. Ali was in a spiral of minimal effort → chose to commit properly.
- Work process: 90-min daily blocks with append-only Work Log in ali-vault/Arch/. Session template: review log → plan → work → wrap & update.
- Schedule: Mon/Thu/Fri 13:00-14:30, Tue/Wed 09:30-11:00 (recurring calendar blocks "💰 Arch Work (Warchest)")

## The Warchest
- Ali's personal fund for security, freedom, and generosity. Separate from business ventures.
- Fuel: Arch ¥1M/month + Givery salary covers life + inheritance (~£1M/¥20M+)
- Investment plan: Max NISA + iDeCo (~¥350k/month) via SBI, overflow → Interactive Brokers
- Allocation: 40% S&P 500, 20% Gold, 20% Bonds, 20% Non-US equities
- Goals: boys' future (¥20-30M), ex-wife pension (¥10M), Mariko's house buyout (¥20-30M), community patronage (¥5-10M), total ~¥70-80M
- Written up in ali-vault/warchest.md — the "why" doc for when motivation dips
- Big tax bill ended November 2025 — financial pressure is lower now

## Family & Relationships
- Ali's two boys and ex-wife live in Sendai (not UK)
- Ali wants to ensure ex-wife is financially secure — recognition for raising the boys well, not compensation
- Mariko (Watanabe Mariko) — stuck in marriage held together by property. Father has only months to live. Ali would buy out the house if he had the means.
- Junto Suzuki — young local martial artist Ali wants to support financially

## Ali's Executive Function
- Morning energy often low due to drinking — fixed morning time blocks are unreliable
- Motivation isn't about the work difficulty (code yields easily) — it's about the narrative/story
- Key lesson: connecting work to a bigger story that hits multiple human needs is what drives action
- "Every hour of Arch work is a brick in the wall"
