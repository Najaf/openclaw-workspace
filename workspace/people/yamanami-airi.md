# Yamanami Airi (山並あいり)

## Basics
- Relationship: Friend / bar owner — someone Ali genuinely likes and is attracted to, but keeps at arm's length
- Birthday: Unknown
- Met: By at least mid-2023 (first vault mention is May 2023); likely a regular at teeny...i before that
- Location: Sendai (Kokubuncho / Iroha Yokocho area)

## Context
Proprietor of **teeny...i**, a small seven-seater whisky bar in Iroha Yokocho (いろは横丁), one of the oldest drinking alleys in Sendai. One of Ali's regular spots — he drops in to see her when out drinking and considers her part of his core Sendai social circle.

Ali is attracted to Airi — he's described her as "pretty and pleasant as usual, always well put together but vaguely awkward" and has written "I would devour Airi given half the chance." However, he deliberately keeps the relationship platonic because they have too many people in common and "any hint of a relationship would just cause chaos and scandal." There's a tension there: he's careful not to appear "together together" with her in social settings, even physically distancing himself from her at parties to avoid rumours.

She's clearly someone Ali cares about — he buys her dinner, thought about taking her on a date to Koyaura (May 2023), and she's invited to important events like his birthday party. She's part of the inner circle.

Airi is connected to many of the Kokubuncho/Iroha Yokocho regulars. Through teeny...i she introduced Ali to **Ikemoto-san** (late 60s surfer/businessman who sold his company), and she's present at social gatherings with that crowd.

## Personality
- Pretty, well put together, pleasant
- "Vaguely awkward" — a slight social awkwardness that Ali seems to find endearing
- Observant — notices social dynamics (e.g. commented on Takeda-san's lack of self-awareness)
- Clearly comfortable in the bar world and knows how to hold court in a seven-seat whisky bar

## People connected through her
- **Ikemoto-san** — met at teeny...i; wealthy older man, surfer, sold his company; hosted a big party (Oct 2025)
- **Takeda-san** — mutual acquaintance; Airi and Ali share opinions about him (lack of self-awareness)
- The regulars of Iroha Yokocho in general

## Timeline
- **2023-05-08** — Ali notes wanting to take Airi on a date to Koyaura, thinking about it for August 8th
- **2023-07-01** — Ali visits teeny...i to see Airi after a night out. They discuss Takeda-san; Airi says she was surprised by his lack of self-awareness. Ali meets "a bunch of shachos" at the bar
- **2023-11-19** — Ali meets Airi in Iroha Yokocho and buys her dinner at Ittaku. Later that night, Ali and friends (Konishi Shunji, Paul Amadio) visit teeny...i where Airi is working
- **2025-08-09** — Airi attends Ali's birthday party at Rob Roy, listed among the core group (alongside Bisha Ali, Haru, Fujiwara no Masanori, Mariko, Sakurai-san)
- **2025-10-16** — Ikemoto's send-off party at Garden in Bunka Yokocho. Airi attends; Ali notes they arrived together and were visibly "together" which he found uncomfortable. He deliberately sat away from her at the venue. He describes her as pretty and pleasant, notes his attraction but the impossibility of acting on it. This evening is captured in detail in "The Doppleganger" essay
