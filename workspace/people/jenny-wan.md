# Jenny (Mingshi) Wan

## Basics
- Relationship: Old friend/ex from kendo days in the UK. Ali's first. Romantic relationship before he went to Japan on JET and she returned to HK.

- Met: Pre-2007, likely through kendo in the UK

- Contact: mingshi.wan@gmail.com, WhatsApp +852 5225 6471

## Context
- Hong Kong-based graphic designer/illustrator, now in "Creative - Design Management"
- Portfolio: mingshiwan.com
- Practiced kendo seriously — competed in taikai, achieved sandan, involved in HK kendo association politics
- Studied Japanese (at least Sankyu level as of 2007)
- Solo traveller — Vietnam, SE Asia, scuba diving
- Did freelance logo design for Ali's **Adventure In Japan** tour business (late 2007, ~¥20,000) — pushed him to articulate his business vision in a really productive exchange
- Ali also approached her about branding for **Mez Restaurant** (family business, 2008)
- Warm, thoughtful correspondent — long personal emails mixing career updates, dating life, and genuine curiosity about Ali's life
- Romantic history pre-emails (Ali's first). The email correspondence reads platonic but the subtext of her visiting Sendai after 15 years of silence is... interesting.
