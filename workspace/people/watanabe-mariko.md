# Watanabe Mariko (渡邉麻里子)

## Basics
- Relationship: Long-term romantic partner / girlfriend
- Birthday: 1983-12-25 (Christmas Day)
- Met: 2019 (via Nitta's meetup per memoir notes; relationship ongoing since then)
- Location: Sendai (had a place in Honcho; Ali worked from there sometimes)
- Aliases in vault: 渡邉麻里子, Mariko, 麻里子, 丹野麻里子 (maiden/former name?), Mariko Watanabe

## Context
- Mariko is married (to a Japanese man), and the divorce situation has been complicated/slow-moving. She has been referenced as sending long messages from her husband that upset her.
- She and Ali have had an ongoing sexual/romantic relationship since 2019, continuing through at least October 2025 (6+ years).
- She has a background in makeup/beauty — got a 顔タイプ診断 (face type diagnosis) qualification and teaches makeup workshops. Gave a presentation on makeup techniques that Ali attended and documented.
- Ali introduced her to Mogi and the katei kyoushi (home tutor) platform project, where she worked alongside Ali and Dai. She also brings Ali to Japanese business networking events.
- Ali has described the sex as reliably excellent ("in a completely different dimension") but the relationship has had tension around jealousy (Ali learning about her past partners), emotional regulation, and Ali's parallel relationship with Kana Kumakura.
- Mariko found out about Kana at some point, which hurt her deeply (per memoir synopsis).
- Ali owed Mariko money at one point (20,000 paid / 100,000 total debt noted Sept 2024).
- She attended Ali's birthday party (Aug 9, 2025) at Rob Roy.
- Going out drinking/eating with Mariko is noted as a trigger that disrupts Ali's focus/discipline.
- Featured prominently in Ali's memoir project — has her own chapter: "Watanabe Mariko - Nitta's meetup • Coffee • First date • Second date • Dating in Sendai • Meeting at the sharehouse • Exploring Sendai • Hazem, Mark, Mac, Brandon, and the reality of a Gaijin Hunter"
- Ali wrote her a long, thoughtful message (April 2023) about "holding space" and emotional regulation in their relationship.
