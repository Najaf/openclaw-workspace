## Context
Ali and Mamiko moved from the UK to Kaigamori, Sendai together with their two sons in July/August 2018. She's Japanese, speaks strong English (TOEIC 890), and was studying further at eikaiwa. Interests include gamelan, Balinese dance, yoga, music, and reading.

They were a functional but strained parenting team. She handled Japanese bureaucracy (banks, kuyakusho, taxes, driving license, insurance, finances). He handled more physical duties (BJJ with Ryu, carrying kids, late-night tantrums). She managed household finances — ¥500-600k/month budget.

### The central tension: Ali's drinking
The LINE chat history (Aug 2018 – Jun 2019) shows a repeating pattern: Ali goes out, says he'll be back by midnight, doesn't respond to messages, comes home at 2-4am. She gets anxious, asks where he is, he's either not answering or in a taxi. She once chained the door — he slept in the garden. She set a ¥20,000 bet he wouldn't make it home by 1am. He lost. Her line: "This is only thing I asked you. If you go out, just tell me."

### Intimacy breakdown
Jan 25, 2019: "Couples relationships are not only sex. Just don't push me only your options. Think about how I feel please." She mentioned needing a therapist. Feb 22: "Never ever talk about her with me please" — awareness of someone else.

### Her exhaustion
Nosebleeds, headaches, stomach problems, insomnia. Raising two demanding young kids largely alone while Ali was frequently out. Isolated in Sendai — sister was only real support. Job hunting was demoralizing (rejected from Tohoku Uni — age, gender, work gap).

### Financial stress
Ali fired from Really English April 2019 (didn't know for a month). Large household expenses, tax debt, credit card bills.

### Warm moments
Yakitori orders at Hakkenden/Daikichi, her buying him chocolate eclairs, fashion advice via Safari magazine, mutual language correction, the BJJ taikai where she brought the boys to watch.

## Post-relationship
By April 2024, Ali wrote: "If Mamiko taught me anything it was that you don't have to put up with people that you don't want to spend time with, that don't have your back." Marriage ended at some point. Boys still in Ali's life — he's written about wanting to spend more time with them, move closer.
