# Yokocho (横丁) Mentions in Ali's Obsidian Vault

Summary of all yokocho-related content found across the vault, organized by topic.

---

## 1. Overview & Geography

Ali lives directly adjacent to the yokochos in central Sendai. His apartment is on a shopping arcade (Ichibancho), and stepping straight across the arcade puts him in front of **Bunka Yokocho** and **Iroha Yokocho**. He describes them as "picturesque Japanese side-streets packed with tiny little bars and restaurants that can only fit seven or eight people" with **around 370 establishments** in total. From his window he can see the arcade canopy and the tin roofs of the yokochos.

**Kokubuncho** (国分町) is about a 7-minute walk further up the arcade — the central entertainment district with hostess clubs, girls bars, snack bars, and regular drinking spots.

## 4. Personal Experiences & Stories

### Daily Life in the Yokochos
Ali estimates he spent **~2,340+ hours** socializing in the iroha-yokocho area over five years (3 nights/week, 3 hours/night, 52 weeks × 5 years), with the real number likely double that. This is a core part of how he learned conversational Japanese.
- **Source:** `Japanese Conversation Article.md`

### "Another Day in My Strange Life in Japan" (Major Essay)
A detailed narrative of a single day featuring:
- Visiting **Yabe Sakaba** to see "Sakurai daddy" (paternal figure)
- Eating roast potatoes at **The Steamers** with Masumi
- A chaotic dinner at **Tori Yoshi** where he helps American tourists, Indonesian/Taiwanese academics, and deals with a rude host — then encounters Shuko (the ear-licker) at the door
- Drinking shochu at **Jaco** — story of Shuko licking his ear leading to hearing loss, eventually resolved by an ENT pulling out a massive earwax creature
- **History lesson:** Post-WWII, Iroha-yokocho emerged as two streets (market + restaurants/bars), administered by the Matsuo-gumi Yakuza. The yakitori restaurant Tori Yoshi was founded ~35 years ago by a young yakuza captain (_wakagashira_)
- **Source:** `Another day in my strange life in Japan.md`

### Speed-Running Sendai (Major Essay)
Epic narrative of a typical night out:
- Starts at a shochu bar in the yokochos, then beef BBQ at "bunyoko" in Bunka Yokocho
- Leaves yokochos → Toichi Ichiba → standing izakaya → authentic cocktail bar → Den of Evil snack bar in Kokubuncho → hostess club → near-altercation with yakuza guy → encounter with "Retsuko-mama" (the "last boss" of Kokubuncho)
- Frames Sendai nightlife as a **rogue-like video game** — each night is a "run" with familiar territory, new dungeons, skill-building, and character encounters
- **Source:** `reflect-import/.../Speed-running Sendai.md`

### The Doppleganger
- Attends Ikemoto-san's retirement party across from his flat, starting at Airi's whisky bar (teeny...i)
- Champagne tower at a venue in **Bunka Yokocho** — "one of the oldest drinking alleys in Sendai"
- Ikemoto ordered expensive sushi from a traditional place across the street
- **Source:** `The Doppleganger.md`

### Daily Notes with Yokocho Activity

- **2023-11-19:** Night starting in Iroha Yokocho → bought dinner at **Ittaku** for Airi → **Neiro** → **Teeny** → **Rock and Roll Bar** → attempted **Garden** in Bunka Yokocho

## 6. Memoir & Writing Projects

The yokochos are a central setting in Ali's memoir project:
- **Act 1** includes "Iroha Yokocho" as a chapter topic, covering "first steps to Iroha Yokocho" via the sharehouse period
- **Jodan Sakaba** is where the yokocho journey begins, leading to "an incredible night with Arai Kyoko"
- Chapter listing explicitly includes: "Iroha Yokocho", "Steamers", "Arai Kyoko"
- The memoir is framed as: "Against the backdrop of Sendai's back-alley bars and corporate boardrooms..."
- **2025-10-03:** Lists "The tale of Iroha Yokocho" as a planned story/chapter

**Sources:** `Memoir/Chapter Listing.md`, `Memoir/Synopsis.md`, `2025-10-03.md`

## 7. Japan at Night Tour Business

Ali runs a paid tour guiding business called **Japan at Night** focused on Sendai's nightlife:
- Tour operation notes reference "Cash/Card issues in the yokochos" as part of the safety briefing template
- Tour planning includes "Cash situation for the yokochos" as a prep item
- Goal to discover 5-10 new venues for the tour
- The yokochos are clearly central to the tour experience

## 8. Kokubuncho (国分町) Nightlife

Kokubuncho is the larger entertainment district beyond the yokochos:
- Described as "relatively safe" for foreigners, filled with hostess clubs, girls bars, snacks
- Ali knows the kyacchi (street touts) by name
- **Retsuko-mama** is the legendary "last boss" — 80s-era woman in kimono, political fixer
- Ali references Kokubuncho in the context of nightlife, dating, and social events
- **"How to speak Japanese the hard way"** lists "Kokubuncho 2-chome (buncho)" as a place for Japanese immersion
- Post-meetup groups ventured to Kokubuncho to sample the Sendai night scene
- Ali has reflected that "there's actually no reason for me to ever go to Kokubuncho" due to money spent, but continues to be drawn there
