## History & Origins

### Post-war Black Market (1945–1946)

Iroha Yokocho's story begins in the ashes of World War II. On July 10, 1945, the Sendai Air Raids (仙台空襲) devastated the city center, leaving it a burnt wasteland. In the rubble, survivors began laying out wooden doors and straw mats to sell whatever remained — scorched ceramics, wooden clogs (geta), and daily necessities. This improvised open-air market became one of Sendai's post-war "black markets" (闇市 / yami-ichi).

### Central Public Market (1946)

In **August 1946 (Showa 21)**, the street vendors pooled resources to formally establish the **Chuo Kosetsu Ichiba (中央公設市場)** — a "Central Public Market." It was conceived as a *temporary* structure for merchants to sell goods while the city rebuilt. Nearly 80 years later, it's still "temporary" — the yokocho was never formally redeveloped, which is part of its charm.

### Evolution to the Present

Over the decades, the market gradually transformed:
- **Early years:** Fresh food shops (butchers, fishmongers, greengrocers), daily necessities, clothing
- **Mid-Showa:** Drinking establishments and restaurants began to appear alongside the retail shops
- **Modern era:** Mix of legacy shops, trendy newcomers, wine bars, Italian restaurants, vintage clothing stores

The yokocho faced multiple threats of redevelopment over the years and suffered damage in the **2011 Great East Japan Earthquake**. During post-earthquake repairs, gas lines and sewage were fixed and — crucially — the **toilets were renovated**. The cooperative's chairman credits this with attracting younger and female customers, transforming the clientele from mostly older regulars to a diverse crowd.

### Name Origin

The kanji 壱弐参 (ichi-ni-san / 1-2-3) are read as "i-ro-ha" — the first three characters of the traditional Japanese syllabary order (いろはにほへと), similar to saying "ABC." The name evokes something fundamental and foundational.

## Layout & Atmosphere

### Physical Structure

- **Two parallel covered alleyways** running roughly north-south, connected at points
- **Aoba Alley (青葉小路):** The corridor closer to Aoba-dori. Originally hosted clothing and item shops.
- **Matsu-Take Alley (松竹小路 / Pine and Bamboo Alley):** The other corridor, originally the restaurant/drinking side. 
- Both are now a mix of everything
- **Covered with a low roof** — protected from rain, walkable year-round
- Approximately **100 shops** line the narrow passages

### Vibe

The atmosphere is deeply **Showa-retro** (昭和レトロ). Narrow corridors barely wide enough for two people to pass. Hand-painted signs, neon lights, paper lanterns. Many shops are so small they seat only 6-10 people — you'll literally rub elbows with locals.

Key features:
- **Hand-pump well (手押しポンプ):** A functioning well from 1948, used until the 1980s for washing and even for the eel restaurant to purge eels. Featured on NHK's *Buratamori* (ブラタモリ) when Tamori visited.
- **Old photographs** displayed near the well showing the yokocho's history
- **Mix of old and new:** A 1868-founded unagi restaurant next to a trendy natural wine bar
- **Intimate scale:** The tiny shop sizes create an atmosphere where strangers become friends over drinks

### Cultural Cameos

- **Buratamori (ブラタモリ):** Tamori visited to see the historic well
- **Saito Kazuyoshi (斉藤和義):** Shot a music video here; fans still come to photograph the same spots
- **Cyndi Lauper:** Has visited the yokocho
- The yokocho has become a popular film/photo location registered with the Sendai-Miyagi Film Commission

## Cultural Significance

Iroha Yokocho represents something increasingly rare in modern Japan: an organic, unplanned urban space that has survived decades of redevelopment pressure. In a city where high-rise buildings dominate the skyline, these low-roofed, cramped alleyways are a living connection to post-war Sendai.

The yokocho embodies:
- **Post-war resilience:** Born from the ashes of air raids, built by ordinary people
- **Showa nostalgia:** A physical space where the Showa era never ended
- **Community continuity:** Shops passed down through generations, regulars who've been coming for decades
- **Democratic drinking culture:** Tiny bars where CEOs sit next to construction workers
- **Sendai identity:** Along with gyutan and Tanabata, the yokocho is a symbol of what makes Sendai distinct

The cooperative has actively worked to preserve the yokocho's character while making it accessible to new generations — renovating infrastructure without modernizing the aesthetic.
