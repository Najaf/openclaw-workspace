### 1. `Another day in my strange life in Japan.md`
**Context:** A long-form creative/diary piece about a single day in Ali's life in Sendai.

**Sakurai / Yabe Sakaba mentions:**
- Ali refers to the owner of **Yabe Sakaba** (a bar in the Iroha Yokocho side alleys) as **"Sakurai daddy"** — a warm, familial nickname.
- Ali told Mariko: *"I haven't seen Sakurai daddy in a while, so I want to drop by today."* Mariko encouraged him to go.
- At Yabe Sakaba, "daddy" poured Ali a soda and lemon. They chatted casually — Sakurai asked about Ali's work, told funny stories about a tour guide, and Ali asked after "mummy" (Sakurai's wife).
- Sakurai invited Ali to a **Christmas party on Dec 24th** — he'd bought a ready-made turkey and was confused about how to serve it. He also asked if Ali might spend the 24th with his boys (Ryu and Kei).
- Sakurai showed Ali **very old faded black-and-white photos** of himself and friends as children at the beach. Ali photographed them and sent them to Mariko.
- When Ali tried to pay, Sakurai **told him to fuck off** (affectionately refused payment). Ali laughed and left.

**Character portrait:** Sakurai is clearly a fatherly figure to Ali — warm, generous (free drinks, refuses payment), interested in Ali's life, and socially connected (inviting Ali to family gatherings). The "daddy/mummy" naming convention signals a quasi-adopted family relationship. The bar itself (Yabe Sakaba) is a small, intimate spot with a noren curtain and sliding door, in the side alleys of what appears to be Iroha Yokocho in Sendai.

### 2. `2025-07-07.md`
**Context:** Daily note focused on weight loss and work planning.

**Yabe Sakaba mention:**
- *"Yesterday 2025-07-06, I went to Yabe sakaba and drank a lot for free, ended up getting quite drunk."*
- Ali identifies this as counter to his weight loss focus. He resolves to stop drinking, noting his weight has ballooned to 83.8kg.
- Going out to drink/eat with Mariko is identified as a trigger.

**Note:** Again, free drinks at Yabe Sakaba — consistent with Sakurai's refusal to let Ali pay.
